"JNA provides Java programs easy access to native shared libraries without "
"writing anything but Java code. No JNI or native code is required. This "
"functionality is comparable to Windows' Platform/Invoke and Python's ctypes. "
"Access is dynamic at runtime without code generation.  JNA's design aims to "
"provide native access in a natural way with a minimum of effort. No "
"boilerplate or generated code is required. While some attention is paid to "
"performance, correctness and ease of use take priority.\n"
"\n"
"The JNA library uses a small native library (libjnidispatch) stub to "
"dynamically invoke native code. The developer uses a Java interface to "
"describe functions and structures in the target native library.  This makes "
"it quite easy to take advantage of native platform features without "
"incurring the high overhead of configuring and building JNI code for "
"multiple platforms."

"Libarchive is a programming library that can create and read several "

"images. The bsdtar program is an implementation of tar(1) that is built on "
"top of libarchive. It started as a test harness, but has grown and is now "
"the standard system tar for FreeBSD 5 and 6.\n"
"\n"
"The libarchive library offers a number of features that make it both very "
"flexible and very powerful. \n"
"- Automatic format detection: libarchive can automatically determine    both "
"the compression and the archive format, regardless of the    data source. "
"Most tar implementations do not automatically detect    the compression "
"format, few implementation that can correctly do    this when reading from "
"stdin or a socket. (The tar program    included with Gunnar Ritter's "
"heirloom collection also does full    automatic format detection.) \n"
"- Writes POSIX formats: libarchive writes POSIX-standard formats,    "
"including \"ustar,\" \"pax interchange format,\" and the POSIX \"cpio\"    "
"format. \n"
"- Supports pax interchange format: Pax interchange format (which,    despite "
"the name, is really an extended tar format) eliminates    almost all "
"limitations of historic tar formats and provides a    standard method for "
"incorporating vendor-specific extensions.    libarchive exploits this "
"extension mechanism to support ACLs and    file flags, for example. (Joerg "
"Schilling's star archiver is    another open-source tar program that "
"supports pax interchange    format.) \n"
"- Reads popular formats: libarchive can read GNU tar, ustar, pax    "
"interchange format, cpio, and older tar variants. The internal    "
"architecture is easily extensible. The only requirement for    support is "
"that it be possible to read the format without seeking    in the file. (For "
"example, a format that includes a compressed    size field before the data "
"cannot be correctly written without    seeking.) \n"
"- High-Level API: the libarchive API makes it fairly simple to build    an "
"archive from a list of filenames or to extract the entries    from an "
"archive. However, the API also provides extreme    flexibility with regards "
"to data sources. For example, there are    generic hooks that allow you to "
"write an archive to a socket or    read data from an archive entry into a "
"memory buffer. \n"
"- Extensible. The internal design uses generic interfaces for compression, "
"archive format detection and decoding, and archive data I/O. It should be "
"very easy to add new formats, new compression methods, or new ways of "
"reading/writing archives."

"librelp is an easy to use library for the RELP protocol. RELP in turn "
"provides reliable event logging over the network (and consequently RELP "
"stands for Reliable Event Logging Protocol). RELP was initiated by Rainer "
"Gerhards after he was finally upset by the lossy nature of plain tcp syslog "
"and wanted a cure for all these dangling issues.\n"
"\n"
"RELP (and hence) librelp assures that no message is lost, not even when "
"connections break and a peer becomes unavailable. The current version of "
"RELP has a minimal window of opportunity for message duplication after a "
"session has been broken due to network problems. In this case, a few "
"messages may be duplicated (a problem that also exists with plain tcp "
"syslog). Future versions of RELP will address this shortcoming.\n"
"\n"
"Please note that RELP is a general-purpose, extensible logging protocol. "
"Even though it was designed to solve the urgent need of rsyslog-to-rsyslog "
"communication, RELP supports many more applications. Extensible command "
"verbs provide ample opportunity to extend the protocol without affecting "
"existing applications."

"CDROM images. The bsdtar program is an implementation of tar(1) that is "
"built on top of libarchive. It started as a test harness, but has grown and "
"is now the standard system tar for FreeBSD 5 and 6.\n"
"\n"
"The libarchive library offers a number of features that make it both very "
"flexible and very powerful. \n"
"- Automatic format detection: libarchive can automatically determine    both "
"the compression and the archive format, regardless of the    data source. "
"Most tar implementations do not automatically detect    the compression "
"format, few implementation that can correctly do    this when reading from "
"stdin or a socket. (The tar program    included with Gunnar Ritter's "
"heirloom collection also does full    automatic format detection.) \n"
"- Writes POSIX formats: libarchive writes POSIX-standard formats,    "
"including \"ustar,\" \"pax interchange format,\" and the POSIX \"cpio\"    "
"format. \n"
"- Supports pax interchange format: Pax interchange format (which,    despite "
"the name, is really an extended tar format) eliminates    almost all "
"limitations of historic tar formats and provides a    standard method for "
"incorporating vendor-specific extensions.    libarchive exploits this "
"extension mechanism to support ACLs and    file flags, for example. (Joerg "
"Schilling's star archiver is    another open-source tar program that "
"supports pax interchange    format.) \n"
"- Reads popular formats: libarchive can read GNU tar, ustar, pax    "
"interchange format, cpio, and older tar variants. The internal    "
"architecture is easily extensible. The only requirement for    support is "
"that it be possible to read the format without seeking    in the file. (For "
"example, a format that includes a compressed    size field before the data "
"cannot be correctly written without    seeking.) \n"
"- High-Level API: the libarchive API makes it fairly simple to build    an "
"archive from a list of filenames or to extract the entries    from an "
"archive. However, the API also provides extreme    flexibility with regards "
"to data sources. For example, there are    generic hooks that allow you to "
"write an archive to a socket or    read data from an archive entry into a "
"memory buffer. \n"
"- Extensible. The internal design uses generic interfaces for compression, "
"archive format detection and decoding, and archive data I/O. It should be "
"very easy to add new formats, new compression methods, or new ways of "
"reading/writing archives."

"libcorrect is a library for Forward Error Correction. By using libcorrect, "
"extra redundancy can be encoded into a packet of data and then be sent "
"across a lossy channel. When the packet is received, it can be decoded to "
"recover the original, pre-encoded data.\n"
"\n"
"libcorrect accomplishes this task with two algorithms, Convolutional codes "
"and Reed-Solomon. Convolutional codes are robust to a constant background "
"noise, while Reed-Solomon error correction is effective at dealing with "
"noise that occurs in bursts. These algorithms have played an important role "
"in telecommunications. libcorrect uses a Viterbi algorithm decoder to decode "
"convolutional codes."
