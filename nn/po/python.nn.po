" * Clean and lightweight API offers a short learning curve and    long-term "

"MySQL.  * Storm is easy to debug, since its code is written with a KISS    "
"principle, and thus is easy to understand.  * Designed from day one to work "

"It often happens that you have text data in Unicode, but you need to "
"represent it in ASCII. For example when integrating with legacy code that "
"doesn't support Unicode, or for ease of entry of non-Roman names on a US "
"keyboard, or when constructing ASCII machine identifiers from human-readable "
"Unicode strings that should still be somewhat intelligible (a popular "
"example of this is when making an URL slug from an article title).\n"
"\n"
"In most of these examples you could represent Unicode characters as \"???\" "
"or \"\\\\15BA\\\\15A0\\\\1610\", to mention two extreme cases. But that's "
"nearly useless to someone who actually wants to read what the text says.\n"
"\n"
"What Unidecode provides is a middle road: function unidecode() takes Unicode "
"data and tries to represent it in ASCII characters (i.e., the universally "
"displayable characters between 0x00 and 0x7F), where the compromises taken "
"when mapping between two character sets are chosen to be near what a human "
"with a US keyboard would choose.\n"
"\n"
"The quality of resulting ASCII representation varies. For languages of "
"western origin it should be between perfect and good. On the other hand "
"transliteration (i.e., conveying, in Roman letters, the pronunciation "
"expressed by the text in some other writing system) of languages like "
"Chinese, Japanese or Korean is a very complex issue and this library does "
"not even attempt to address it. It draws the line at context-free character-"
"by-character mapping. So a good rule of thumb is that the further the script "
"you are transliterating is from Latin alphabet, the worse the "
"transliteration will be.\n"
"\n"
"Note that this module generally produces better results than simply "
"stripping accents from characters (which can be done in Python with built-in "
"functions). It is based on hand-tuned character mappings that for example "
"also contain ASCII approximations for symbols and non-Latin alphabets.\n"

"The biggest reason to use twine is that python setup.py upload uploads files "

"password to a MITM attack. Twine uses only verified TLS to upload to PyPI "
"protecting your credentials from theft.\n"
"\n"
"Secondly it allows you to precreate your distribution files. python setup.py "
"upload only allows you to upload something that you've created in the same "
"command invocation. This means that you cannot test the exact file you're "
"going to upload to PyPI to ensure that it works before uploading it.\n"
"\n"
"Finally it allows you to pre-sign your files and pass the .asc files into "
"the command line invocation (twine upload twine-1.0.1.tar.gz twine-1.0.1.tar."
"gz.asc). This enables you to be assured that you're typing your gpg "
"passphrase into gpg itself and not anything else since *you* will be the one "
"directly executing gpg --detach-sign -a <filename>.\n"
"\n"
" Features\n"

"Beautiful Soup is a Python HTML/XML parser designed for quick turnaround "
"projects like screen-scraping. Three features make it powerful:\n"
"\n"
"* Beautiful Soup won't choke if you give it bad markup. It yields a parse "
"tree   that makes approximately as much sense as your original document. "
"This is   usually good enough to collect the data you need and run away\n"
"\n"
"* Beautiful Soup provides a few simple methods and Pythonic idioms for   "
"navigating, searching, and modifying a parse tree: a toolkit for dissecting "
"a   document and extracting what you need. You don't have to create a "
"custom   parser for each application\n"
"\n"
"* Beautiful Soup automatically converts incoming documents to Unicode and   "
"outgoing documents to UTF-8. You don't have to think about encodings, "
"unless   the document doesn't specify an encoding and Beautiful Soup can't "
"autodetect   one. Then you just have to specify the original encoding\n"
"\n"
"Beautiful Soup parses anything you give it, and does the tree traversal "
"stuff for you. You can tell it \"Find all the links\", or \"Find all the "
"links of class externalLink\", or \"Find all the links whose urls match "
"\"foo.com\", or \"Find the table heading that's got bold text, then give me "
"that text.\"\n"
"\n"
"Valuable data that was once locked up in poorly-designed websites is now "
"within your reach. Projects that would have taken hours take only minutes "
"with Beautiful Soup. Beautiful Soup."
