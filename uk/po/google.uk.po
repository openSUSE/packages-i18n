"Allerta is an open source typeface designed for use in signage. Allerta was "
"designed to be easily and quickly read from a distance. Each letter exploits "
"the most unique aspects of that individual letter so that each character can "
"be easily distinguished from any other.\n"
"\n"
"Allerta has been released as an open source project so that those countries, "
"communities, and/or organizations without a proper signage system may have a "
"way of quickly designing and implementing one. While Allerta is complete "
"with a large character set, because it is open source, modification and "
"expansion is encouraged.\n"
"\n"
"For the more urgent of circumstances, Allerta Stencil and an accompanying "
"kit have been designed so that signage can be created with nothing more than "
"the kit of letters, a can of spray paint, and the nearest available "
"substrate. Although the stencil kit may allude the finer points of "
"typographic spacing, it is intended to serve the most basic purpose of "
"signage: guiding people towards their destination or towards assistance.\n"
"\n"
"The name Allerta is derived from the origins of the word alert (adj. swift, "
"v. to advise or warn). The Italian origin all'erta literally means on the "
"lookout.\n"

"Geometric sans serif typefaces have been a popular design tool ever since "
"these actors took to the world’s stage. Poppins is one of the new comers to "
"this long tradition. With support for the Devanagari and Latin writing "
"systems, it is an internationalist take on the genre.\n"
"\n"
"Many of the Latin glyphs (such as the ampersand) are more constructed and "
"rationalist than is typical. The Devanagari design is particularly new, and "
"is the first ever Devanagari typeface with a range of weights in this genre. "
"Just like the Latin, the Devanagari is based on pure geometry, particularly "
"circles.\n"
"\n"
"Each letterform is nearly monolinear, with optical corrections applied to "
"stroke joints where necessary to maintain an even typographic color. The "
"Devanagari base character height and the Latin ascender height are equal; "
"Latin capital letters are shorter than the Devanagari characters, and the "
"Latin x-height is set rather high.\n"
"\n"
"The Devanagari is designed by Ninad Kale. The Latin is by Jonny Pinhorn."
