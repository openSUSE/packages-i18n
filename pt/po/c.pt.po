"look up the server that actually holds this mail account's mailbox, and "
"establish a proxy connection to the server, all in a single, seamless "
"process. Mail accounts can be moved between different servers, to achieve "
"optimum resource usage.\n"

"bandwidth. If you are new to Courier-IMAP, this may sound a bit "

"taking small, easy steps. Your first step will be to set up a small Courier-"

"can then begin exploring its advanced features.\n"
