"two levels of API: source level and bytecode level. If the users use the "

"specifications of the Java bytecode. The whole API is designed with only the "
"vocabulary of the Java language. You can even specify inserted bytecode in "
"the form of source text; Javassist compiles it on the fly. On the other "
"hand, the bytecode-level API allows the users to directly edit a class file "

"XOM is designed to be easy to learn and easy to use. It works very straight-"
"forwardly, and has a very shallow learning curve. Assuming you're already "
"familiar with XML, you should be able to get up and running with XOM very "
"quickly.\n"
"\n"
"XOM is the only XML API that makes no compromises on correctness. XOM only "
"accepts namespace well-formed XML documents, and only allows you to create "
"namespace well-formed XML documents. (In fact, it's a little stricter than "
"that: it actually guarantees that all documents are round-trippable and have "
"well-defined XML infosets.) XOM manages your XML so you don't have to. With "
"XOM, you can focus on the unique value of your application, and trust XOM to "
"get the XML right.\n"
"\n"
"XOM is fairly unique in that it is a dual streaming/tree-based API. "
"Individual nodes in the tree can be processed while the document is still "
"being built. The enables XOM programs to operate almost as fast as the "
"underlying parser can supply data. You don't need to wait for the document "
"to be completely parsed before you can start working with it.\n"
"\n"
"XOM is very memory efficient. If you read an entire document into memory, "
"XOM uses as little memory as possible. More importantly, XOM allows you to "
"filter documents as they're built so you don't have to build the parts of "
"the tree you aren't interested in. For instance, you can skip building text "
"nodes that only represent boundary white space, if such white space is not "
"significant in your application. You can even process a document piece by "
"piece and throw away each piece when you're done with it. XOM has been used "
"to process documents that are gigabytes in size.\n"
"\n"
"XOM includes built-in support for a number of XML technologies including "
"Namespaces in XML, XPath, XSLT, XInclude, xml:id, and Canonical XML. XOM "
"documents can be converted to and from SAX and DOM."
