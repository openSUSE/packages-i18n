"rdiff-backup backs up one directory to another, possibly over a network. The "
"target directory ends up a copy of the source directory, but extra reverse "
"diffs are stored in a special subdirectory of that target directory, so you "
"can still recover files lost some time ago. The idea is to combine the best "
"features of a mirror and an incremental backup. rdiff-backup also preserves "
"subdirectories, hard links, dev files, permissions, uid/gid ownership, and "
"modification times. Also, rdiff-backup can operate in a bandwidth efficient "
"manner over a pipe, like rsync. Thus you can use rdiff-backup and ssh to "
"securely back a hard drive up to a remote location, and only the differences "
"will be transmitted. Finally, rdiff-backup is easy to use and settings have "
"sensical defaults."

"Relax-and-Recover (abbreviated ReaR) is the leading Free Software disaster "
"recovery framework.\n"
"\n"
"Relax-and-Recover is written entirely in the native language for system "
"administration: as bash scripts.\n"
"\n"
"Experienced users and system admins can adapt or extend the ReaR scripts to "
"make it work for their particular cases.\n"
"\n"
"Relax-and-Recover is a modular framework with ready-to-go workflows for "
"common situations.\n"
"\n"
"The basic workflow is as follows: Specify its configuration in /etc/rear/"
"local.conf (cf. /usr/share/rear/conf/examples) and run \"rear mkbackup\" to "
"create a backup.tar.gz on a NFS server and a bootable recovery ISO image for "
"your system. A recovery medium which is made from the ISO image boots a "
"special ReaR recovery system. Log in as root and run \"rear recover\" which "
"does the following steps: It runs the ReaR installer that recreates the "
"basic system, in particular the system disk partitioning with filesystems "
"and mount points, then it restores the backup from the NFS server and "
"finally it installs the boot loader. Finally remove the recovery medium and "
"reboot the recreated system.\n"
"\n"
"Relax-and-Recover supports various kind of boot media for the recovery "
"system (incl. ISO, PXE, OBDR tape, USB or eSATA storage), a variety of "
"network protocols (incl. sftp, ftp, http, nfs, cifs) for storage and backup "
"as well as various external third-party backup methods (incl. IBM Tivoli "
"Storage Manager, HP DataProtector, Symantec NetBackup, EMC NetWorker, FDR/"
"Upstream, NovaBACKUP DC, Bareos, Bacula, rsync, rbme).\n"
"\n"
"Warning for users who like to upgrade Relax-and-Recover: Users who already "
"use it must re-validate that their particular disaster recovery procedure "
"still works.\n"
"\n"
"Additionally when you already use Relax-and-Recover and you upgrade software "
"that is related to the basic system (e.g. kernel, storage, bootloader, init, "
"networking) or you do other changes in your basic system, you must also re-"
"validate that your particular disaster recovery procedure still works for "
"you.\n"
"\n"
"You must test in advance that it works in your particular case to recreate "
"your particular system with your particular recovery medium and that the "
"recreated system can boot on its own and that the recreated system with all "
"its system services still work as you need it in your particular case.\n"
"\n"
"You must have replacement hardware available on which your system can be "
"recreated and you must try out if it works to recreate your system with your "
"recovery medium on your replacement hardware.\n"
"\n"
"Be prepared that your system recovery fails to recreate your system. When it "
"fails to recreate your system it is usually a dead end. Be prepared for a "
"manual recreation from scratch. Always have all information available that "
"you need to recreate your particular system manually. Manually recreate your "
"system on your replacement hardware as an exercise.\n"

"\n"
"Four classes are provided: tsl::robin_map, tsl::robin_set, tsl::robin_pg_map "

"Relax-and-Recover (abbreviated rear) is the leading Free Software disaster "
"recovery framework.\n"
"\n"
"Relax-and-Recover is written entirely in the native language for system "
"administration: as bash scripts.\n"
"\n"
"Experienced users and system admins can adapt or extend the rear scripts to "
"make it work for their particular cases.\n"
"\n"
"Relax-and-Recover is a modular framework with ready-to-go workflows for "
"common situations.\n"
"\n"
"The basic workflow is as follows: Specify its configuration in /etc/rear/"
"local.conf (cf. /usr/share/rear/conf/examples) and run \"rear mkbackup\" to "
"create a backup.tar.gz on a NFS server and a bootable recovery ISO image for "
"your system. A recovery medium which is made from the ISO image boots a "
"special rear recovery system. Log in as root and run \"rear recover\" which "
"does the following steps: It runs the rear installer that recreates the "
"basic system, in particular the system disk partitioning with filesystems "
"and mount points, then it restores the backup from the NFS server and "
"finally it installs the boot loader. Finally remove the recovery medium and "
"reboot the recreated system.\n"
"\n"
"Relax-and-Recover supports various kind of boot media for the recovery "
"system (incl. ISO, PXE, OBDR tape, USB or eSATA storage), a variety of "
"network protocols (incl. sftp, ftp, http, nfs, cifs) for storage and backup "
"as well as various external third-party backup methods (incl. IBM Tivoli "
"Storage Manager, HP DataProtector, Symantec NetBackup, EMC NetWorker, FDR/"
"Upstream, NovaBACKUP DC, Bareos, Bacula, rsync, rbme).\n"
"\n"
"Warning for users who like to upgrade Relax-and-Recover: Users who already "
"use it must re-validate that their particular disaster recovery procedure "
"still works.\n"
"\n"
"Additionally when you already use Relax-and-Recover and you upgrade software "
"that is related to the basic system (e.g. kernel, storage, bootloader, init, "
"networking) or you do other changes in your basic system, you must also re-"
"validate that your particular disaster recovery procedure still works for "
"you.\n"
"\n"
"You must test in advance that it works in your particular case to recreate "
"your particular system with your particular recovery medium and that the "
"recreated system can boot on its own and that the recreated system with all "
"its system services still work as you need it in your particular case.\n"
"\n"
"You must have replacement hardware available on which your system can be "
"recreated and you must try out if it works to recreate your system with your "
"recovery medium on your replacement hardware.\n"
"\n"
"Be prepared that your system recovery fails to recreate your system. When it "
"fails to recreate your system it is usually a dead end. Be prepared for a "
"manual recreation from scratch. Always have all information available that "
"you need to recreate your particular system manually. Manually recreate your "
"system on your replacement hardware as an exercise.\n"
