" * Clean and lightweight API offers a short learning curve and    long-term "

"(different classes have very clear    boundaries, with small and clean "

"MySQL.  * Storm is easy to debug, since its code is written with a KISS    "
"principle, and thus is easy to understand.  * Designed from day one to work "
"both at the low end, with trivial    small databases, and the high end, with "
"applications accessing    billion row tables and committing to multiple "

"This is   usually good enough to collect the data you need and run away \n"
"* Beautiful Soup provides a few simple methods and Pythonic idioms for   "
"navigating, searching, and modifying a parse tree: a toolkit for dissecting "
"a   document and extracting what you need. You don't have to create a "
"custom   parser for each application \n"
"* Beautiful Soup automatically converts incoming documents to Unicode and   "
"outgoing documents to UTF-8. You don't have to think about encodings, "
"unless   the document doesn't specify an encoding and Beautiful Soup can't "
"autodetect   one. Then you just have to specify the original encoding\n"
"\n"
"Beautiful Soup parses anything you give it, and does the tree traversal "
"stuff for you. You can tell it \"Find all the links\", or \"Find all the "
"links of class externalLink\", or \"Find all the links whose urls match "
"\"foo.com\", or \"Find the table heading that's got bold text, then give me "
