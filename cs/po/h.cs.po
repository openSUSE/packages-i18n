"Classified Advertisements (classads) are the lingua franca of HTCondor. They "
"are used for describing jobs, workstations, and other resources. They are "
"exchanged by HTCondor processes to schedule jobs. They are logged to files "
"for statistical and debugging purposes. They are used to enquire about "
"current state of the system.\n"
"\n"
"A classad is a mapping from attribute names to expressions. In the simplest "
"cases, the expressions are simple constants (integer, floating point, or "
"string). A classad is thus a form of property list. Attribute expressions "
"can also be more complicated. There is a protocol for evaluating an "
"attribute expression of a classad vis a vis another ad. For example, the "
"expression \"other.size > 3\" in one ad evaluates to true if the other ad "
"has an attribute named size and the value of that attribute is (or evaluates "
"to) an integer greater than three. Two classads match if each ad has an "
"attribute requirements that evaluates to true in the context of the other "
"ad. Classad matching is used by the HTCondor central manager to determine "
"the compatibility of jobs and workstations where they may be run."
