#~ "Apache Ant is a Java-based build tool. In theory, it is kind of like "
#~ "Make, but without Make's wrinkles.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Why another build tool when there is already make, gnumake, nmake, jam, "
#~ "and others? Because all those tools have limitations that Ant's original "
#~ "author could not live with when developing software across multiple "
#~ "platforms. Make-like tools are inherently shell-based--they evaluate a "
#~ "set of dependencies then execute commands, not unlike what you would "
#~ "issue in a shell. This means that you can easily extend these tools by "
#~ "using or writing any program for the OS that you are working on. However, "
#~ "this also means that you limit yourself to the OS, or at least the OS "
#~ "type, such as Unix, that you are working on.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Makefiles are inherently evil as well. Anybody who has worked on them for "
#~ "any time has run into the dreaded tab problem. \"Is my command not "
#~ "executing because I have a space in front of my tab???\" said the "
#~ "original author of Ant way too many times. Tools like Jam took care of "
#~ "this to a great degree, but still have yet another format to use and "
#~ "remember.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Ant is different. Instead of a model where it is extended with shell-"
#~ "based commands, Ant is extended using Java classes. Instead of writing "
#~ "shell commands, the configuration files are XML-based, calling out a "
#~ "target tree where various tasks are executed. Each task is run by an "
#~ "object that implements a particular task interface.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Granted, this removes some of the expressive power that is inherent by "
#~ "being able to construct a shell command such as `find . -name foo -exec "
#~ "rm {}`, but it gives you the ability to be cross-platform--to work "
#~ "anywhere and everywhere. If you really need to execute a shell command, "
#~ "Ant has an <exec> task that allows different commands to be executed "
#~ "based on the OS used."

#~ "rozšířit libovolným programem operačního systému, na kterém pracujete. "
