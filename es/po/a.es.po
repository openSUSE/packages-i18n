"Seven Kingdoms made departures from the traditional real-time strategy "

"individually, who each have a spying skill that increases over time. The "
"player is also responsible for catching spies in their own kingdom. Inns "
"built within the game allow players to hire mercenaries of various "
"occupations, skill levels, and races. Skilled spies of enemy races are "
"essential to a well-conducted espionage program, and the player can bolster "
"his forces by grabbing a skilled fighter or give ones own factories, mines, "
"and towers of science, a boost by hiring a skilled professional.\n"

"Enlight Software decided to release the game to the Open Source community in "
"August 2009. At that time everything, but the music, was released under the "
