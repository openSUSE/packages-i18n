"Seven Kingdoms made departures from the traditional real-time strategy "

"features an espionage system that allows players to train and control spies "
"individually, who each have a spying skill that increases over time. The "
"player is also responsible for catching spies in their own kingdom. Inns "
"built within the game allow players to hire mercenaries of various "
"occupations, skill levels, and races. Skilled spies of enemy races are "
"essential to a well-conducted espionage program, and the player can bolster "
"his forces by grabbing a skilled fighter or give ones own factories, mines, "
"and towers of science, a boost by hiring a skilled professional.\n"

"Apache Ant is a Java-based build tool. In theory, it is kind of like Make, "
"but without Make's wrinkles.\n"
"\n"
"Why another build tool when there is already make, gnumake, nmake, jam, and "
"others? Because all those tools have limitations that Ant's original author "
"could not live with when developing software across multiple platforms. Make-"
"like tools are inherently shell-based--they evaluate a set of dependencies "
"then execute commands, not unlike what you would issue in a shell. This "
"means that you can easily extend these tools by using or writing any program "
"for the OS that you are working on. However, this also means that you limit "
"yourself to the OS, or at least the OS type, such as Unix, that you are "
"working on.\n"
"\n"
"Makefiles are inherently evil as well. Anybody who has worked on them for "
"any time has run into the dreaded tab problem. \"Is my command not executing "
"because I have a space in front of my tab???\" said the original author of "
"Ant way too many times. Tools like Jam took care of this to a great degree, "
"but still have yet another format to use and remember.\n"
"\n"
"Ant is different. Instead of a model where it is extended with shell-based "
"commands, Ant is extended using Java classes. Instead of writing shell "
"commands, the configuration files are XML-based, calling out a target tree "
"where various tasks are executed. Each task is run by an object that "
"implements a particular task interface.\n"
"\n"
"Granted, this removes some of the expressive power that is inherent by being "
"able to construct a shell command such as `find . -name foo -exec rm {}`, "
"but it gives you the ability to be cross-platform--to work anywhere and "
"everywhere. If you really need to execute a shell command, Ant has an <exec> "
"task that allows different commands to be executed based on the OS used."
msgstr ""
"Apache Ant è uno strumento di compilazione basato su Java. In teoria è un "
"po' come Make, ma senza le sue \"rughe\".\n"
"\n"
"Perché un altro strumento di compilazione quando ci sono già make, gnumake, "
"nmake, jam e altri? Perché tutti questi strumenti hanno limiti che l'autore "
"originale di Ant non poteva accettare quando sviluppava programmi su più "
"piattaforme. Gli strumenti tipo Make sono intrinsecamente basati sulla "
"shell, essi valutano un insieme di dipendenze e poi eseguono i comandi, non "
"diversamente da quello che si fa con una shell. Questo significa che è "
"possibile estendere facilmente questi strumenti utilizzando o scrivendo "
"altri programmi per il sistema operativo con cui si sta lavorando. Questo "
"però significa anche limitarsi al sistema operativo o almeno al tipo di "
"sistema operativo, come Unix, con cui si sta lavorando.\n"
"\n"
"Anche i makefile sono intrinsecamente cattivi. Chiunque abbia lavorato con "
"loro per un po' ha sperimentato il temuto problema delle tabulazioni. \"Il "
"mio comando non è stato eseguito perché c'era uno spazio davanti alla "
"tabulazione???\" disse decisamente troppe volte l'autore originale di Ant. "
"Gli strumenti come Jam si sono occupati in gran parte di questo, ma rimane "
"ancora un altro formato da utilizzare e ricordare.\n"
"\n"
"Ant è differente. Invece di un modello in cui esso viene esteso con comandi "
"basati sulla shell, Ant viene esteso utilizzando classi di Java. Invece di "
"scrivere comandi della shell, i file di configurazione sono basati su XML "
"che chiama un albero di obiettivi in cui vengono eseguiti i vari compiti. "
"Ogni compito viene eseguito da un oggetto che implementa una particolare "
"interfaccia del compito.\n"
"\n"
"Certo, questo elimina una parte del potere espressivo che è intrinseco del "
"poter costruire un comando shell come `find . -name foo -exec rm {}`, ma dà "
"la possibilità di essere multipiattaforma, di funzionare ovunque. Se si ha "
"proprio la necessità di eseguire un comando shell, Ant ha un'attività <exec> "
"che permette di eseguire diversi comandi basati sul sistema operativo in uso."

"The introduction of the Collections API by Sun in JDK 1.2 has been a boon to "
"quick and effective Java programming. Ready access to powerful data "
"structures has accelerated development by reducing the need for custom "
"container classes around each core object.  Most Java2 APIs are "
"significantly easier to use because of the Collections API. However, there "
"are certain holes left unfilled by Sun's implementations, and the Jakarta-"
"Commons Collections Component strives to fulfill them. Among the features of "
"this package are: - special-purpose implementations of Lists and Maps for "
"fast access\n"
"\n"
"- adapter classes from Java1-style containers (arrays,   enumerations) to "
"Java2-style collections\n"
"\n"
"- methods to test or create typical set theory properties   of collections "
"such as union, intersection, and closure"
msgstr ""
"L'introduzione dell'API Collections da parte di Sun in JDK 1.2 è stata un "
"favore alla programmazione Java veloce ed efficace. Il pronto accesso a "
"potenti strutture dati ha accelerato lo sviluppo riducendo la necessità di "
"classi contenitore personalizzate attorno a ogni oggetto principale. Molte "
"delle API Java2 sono significativamente più semplici da usare grazie all'API "
"Collections. Comunque ci sono certi buchi lasciati aperti dalle "
"implementazioni Sun e il componente Jakarta-Commons Collections si sforza di "
"chiuderli. Tra le funzionalità di questo pacchetto ci sono:\n"
" - implementazioni speciali di liste e mappe per un accesso rapido\n"
"\n"
"- classi adattatrici dai contenitori stile Java1 (vettori, enumerazioni) "
"alle raccolte in stile Java2\n"
"\n"
"- metodi per verificare o creare tipiche proprietà di teoria degli insiemi "
"delle collezioni come unione, intersezione e chiusura."

"mod_python allows embedding Python within the Apache HTTP server for a "
"considerable boost in performance and added flexibility in designing Web-"
"based applications.\n"
"\n"
"Apache processes requests in stages (for example: read the request, parse "
"headers, check access, and so on). These stages can be implemented by "
"functions called handlers. Traditionally, handlers are written in C and "
"compiled into Apache modules. mod_python provides a way to extend Apache "
"functionality by writing Apache handlers in Python. For a detailed "
"description of the Apache request processing process, see the Apache API "
"notes.\n"
"\n"
"For most programmers, the request and the authentication handlers provide "
"everything required. To ease migration from CGI and Httpdapy, two handlers "
"are provided that simulate these environments, allowing a user to run "
"scripts under mod_python with (for the most part) no changes to the code.\n"
"\n"
"mod_python originated from a project called Httpdapy. For a long time, "
"Httpdapy was not called mod_python because Httpdapy was not meant to be "
"Apache-specific. Httpdapy was designed to be cross-platform and was "
"initially written for the Netscape server.\n"
"\n"
"Usage Hints:\n"
"\n"
"To load mod_python into Apache, add it to APACHE_MODULES in /etc/sysconfig/"
"apache2. The configuration is described in /usr/share/doc/packages/apache2-"
"mod_python/doc-html/index.html."
msgstr ""
"mod_python permette di integrare Python all'interno del server HTTP Apache "
"per ottenere un considerevole aumento delle prestazioni e aggiungere "
"flessibilità nella progettazione delle applicazioni basate sul web.\n"
"\n"
"Apache elabora le richieste in fasi (per esempio: legge la richiesta, "
"analizza le intestazioni, controlla l'accesso e così via). Queste fasi "
"possono essere implementate tramite funzioni chiamate gestori. "
"Tradizionalmente i gestori sono scritti in C e compilati nei moduli di "
"Apache. mod_python fornisce un modo per estendere le funzionalità di Apache "
"scrivendo gestori per Apache in Python. Per una descrizione dettagliata del "
"processo di elaborazione delle richieste in Apache, vedere le note delle API "
"di Apache.\n"
"\n"
"Per la maggior parte dei programmatori i gestori delle richieste e dell' "
"autenticazione forniscono tutto il necessario. Per una facile migrazione da "
"CGI e Httpdapy sono forniti due gestori che simulano questi ambienti "
"permettendo ad un utente di eseguire script sotto mod_python senza (per la "
"maggior parte) alcuna modifica al codice.\n"
"\n"
"mod_python è originato da un progetto chiamato Httpdapy. Per lungo tempo "
"Httpdapy non è stato chiamato mod_python perché non era pensato per essere "
"specifico per Apache. Httpdapy era progettato per essere multipiattaforma ed "
"è stato inizialmente scritto per il server Netscape.\n"
"\n"
"Consigli d'uso:\n"
"\n"
"per caricare mod_python in Apache aggiungerlo a APACHE_MODULES in /etc/"
