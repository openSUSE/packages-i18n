"AnyEvent provides a uniform interface to various event loops. This allows "

"\n"
"The interface itself is vaguely similar, but not identical to the Event "
"module.\n"
"\n"
"During the first call of any watcher-creation method, the module tries to "
"detect the currently loaded event loop by probing whether one of the "
"following modules is already loaded: EV, AnyEvent::Loop, Event, Glib, Tk, "
"Event::Lib, Qt, POE. The first one found is used. If none are detected, the "
"module tries to load the first four modules in the order given; but note "
"that if EV is not available, the pure-perl AnyEvent::Loop should always "
"work, so the other two are not normally tried.\n"

"form where they can enter authentication credentials. The credentials are "
"posted to the server where AuthCookie verifies them and returns a session "
"key.\n"
"\n"
"The session key is returned to the user's browser as a cookie. As a cookie, "
"the browser will pass the session key on every subsequent accesses. "
"AuthCookie will verify the session key and re-authenticate the user.\n"

"All you have to do is write a custom module that inherits from AuthCookie. "
"Your module is a class which implements two methods: \n"
"* 'authen_cred()'\n"
"\n"
"Verify the user-supplied credentials and return a session key. The session "
"key can be any string - often you'll use some string containing username, "
"timeout info, and any other information you need to determine access to "

"secret key. \n"
"* 'authen_ses_key()'\n"

"during a previous request) and return the user ID. This user ID will be fed "

"\n"
"By using AuthCookie versus Apache's built-in AuthBasic you can design your "
"own authentication system. There are several benefits. \n"
"* 1.\n"
"\n"
"The client doesn't *have* to pass the user credentials on every subsequent "

"on the first request only, and subsequent requests don't need to send this "
"(potentially sensitive) information. This is known as \"ticket-based\" "
"authentication. \n"
"* 2.\n"
"\n"
"When you determine that the client should stop using the credentials/session "
"key, the server can tell the client to delete the cookie. Letting users "
"\"log out\" is a notoriously impossible-to-solve problem of AuthBasic. \n"
"* 3.\n"
"\n"
"AuthBasic dialog boxes are ugly. You can design your own HTML login forms "
"when you use AuthCookie. \n"
"* 4.\n"
"\n"
"You can specify the domain of a cookie using PerlSetVar commands. For "
"instance, if your AuthName is 'WhatEver', you can put the command\n"
"\n"
" PerlSetVar WhatEverDomain .yourhost.com\n"
"\n"
"into your server setup file and your access cookies will span all hosts "
"ending in '.yourhost.com'. \n"
"* 5.\n"
"\n"
"You can optionally specify the name of your cookie using the 'CookieName' "
"directive. For instance, if your AuthName is 'WhatEver', you can put the "
"command\n"
"\n"
" PerlSetVar WhatEverCookieName MyCustomName\n"
"\n"
"into your server setup file and your cookies for this AuthCookie realm will "
"be named MyCustomName. Default is AuthType_AuthName. \n"
"* 6.\n"
"\n"
"By default users must satisfy ALL of the 'require' directives. If you want "

"either). The username is used to set the remote user as if Basic "
"Authentication was used.\n"
"\n"
"On an attempt to access a protected location without a valid cookie being "

"to the same entry page when they log in). This login form has fields for "
"username and password. On submitting it, the username and password are "

"password in the database; the password in the database can be plaintext, or "
"a crypt() or md5_hex() checksum of the password. If this succeeds, the user "
"is issued a ticket. This ticket contains the username, an issue time, an "
"expire time, and an MD5 checksum of those and a secret key for the server. "
"It can optionally be encrypted before returning it to the client in the "

"On this access and any subsequent attempt to access a protected document, "
"the browser returns the ticket to the server. The server unencrypts it if "
"encrypted tickets are enabled, then extracts the username, issue time, "
"expire time and checksum. A new checksum is calculated of the username, "
"issue time, expire time and the secret key again; if it agrees with the "
"checksum that the client supplied, we know that the data has not been "

"CGI::Ajax is an object-oriented module that provides a unique mechanism for "
"using perl code asynchronously from javascript- enhanced HTML pages. CGI::"
"Ajax unburdens the user from having to write extensive javascript, except "
"for associating an exported method with a document-defined event (such as "
"onClick, onKeyUp, etc). CGI::Ajax also mixes well with HTML containing more "
"complex javascript.\n"
"\n"
"CGI::Ajax supports methods that return single results or multiple results to "
"the web page, and supports returning values to multiple DIV elements on the "
"HTML page.\n"
"\n"
"Using CGI::Ajax, the URL for the HTTP GET/POST request is automatically "
"generated based on HTML layout and events, and the page is then dynamically "
"updated with the output from the perl function. Additionally, CGI::Ajax "
"supports mapping URL's to a CGI::Ajax function name, so you can separate "
"your code processing over multiple scripts.\n"
"\n"
"Other than using the Class::Accessor module to generate CGI::Ajax' accessor "
"methods, CGI::Ajax is completely self-contained - it does not require you to "
"install a larger package or a full Content Management System, etc.\n"
"\n"
"We have added _support_ for other CGI handler/decoder modules, like the CGI::"
"Simple manpage or the CGI::Minimal manpage, but we can't test these since we "
"run mod_perl2 only here. CGI::Ajax checks to see if a header() method is "
"available to the CGI object, and then uses it. If method() isn't available, "
"it creates it's own minimal header.\n"
"\n"
"A primary goal of CGI::Ajax is to keep the module streamlined and maximally "
"flexible. We are trying to keep the generated javascript code to a minimum, "
"but still provide users with a variety of methods for deploying CGI::Ajax. "
"And VERY little user javascript."

"Carp::Assert is intended for a purpose like the ANSI C library http://en."
"wikipedia.org/wiki/Assert.h. If you're already familiar with assert.h, then "
"you can probably skip this and go straight to the FUNCTIONS section.\n"
"\n"
"Assertions are the explicit expressions of your assumptions about the "
"reality your program is expected to deal with, and a declaration of those "
"which it is not. They are used to prevent your program from blissfully "
"processing garbage inputs (garbage in, garbage out becomes garbage in, error "
"out) and to tell you when you've produced garbage output. (If I was going to "
"be a cynic about Perl and the user nature, I'd say there are no user inputs "
"but garbage, and Perl produces nothing but...)\n"
"\n"
"An assertion is used to prevent the impossible from being asked of your "
"code, or at least tell you when it does. For example:\n"
"\n"
"         sub my_sqrt {         my($num) = shift;\n"
"\n"
"                 assert($num >= 0);\n"
"\n"
"        return sqrt $num;     }\n"
"\n"
"The assertion will warn you if a negative number was handed to your "
"subroutine, a reality the routine has no intention of dealing with.\n"
"\n"
"An assertion should also be used as something of a reality check, to make "
"sure what your code just did really did happen:\n"
"\n"
"    open(FILE, $filename) || die $!;     @stuff = <FILE>;     @stuff = "
"do_something(@stuff);\n"
"\n"
"         assert(@stuff > 0);\n"
"\n"
"The assertion makes sure you have some @stuff at the end. Maybe the file was "
"empty, maybe do_something() returned an empty list... either way, the "
"assert() will give you a clue as to where the problem lies, rather than 50 "
"lines down at when you wonder why your program isn't printing anything.\n"
"\n"
"Since assertions are designed for debugging and will remove themelves from "
"production code, your assertions should be carefully crafted so as to not "
"have any side-effects, change any variables, or otherwise have any effect on "
"your program. Here is an example of a bad assertation:\n"
"\n"
"    assert($error = 1 if $king ne 'Henry');  # Bad!\n"
"\n"
"It sets an error flag which may then be used somewhere else in your program. "
"When you shut off your assertions with the $DEBUG flag, $error will no "
"longer be set.\n"
"\n"
"Here's another example of *bad* use:\n"
"\n"
"    assert($next_pres ne 'Dan Quayle' or goto Canada);  # Bad!\n"
"\n"
"This assertion has the side effect of moving to Canada should it fail. This "
"is a very bad assertion since error handling should not be placed in an "
"assertion, nor should it have side-effects.\n"
"\n"
"In short, an assertion is an executable comment. For instance, instead of "
"writing this\n"
"\n"
"         $life = begin_life();\n"

"statement inside the \"'qw()'\" term (or argument list).\n"
"\n"
"Suppose you have a family of modules or classes named \"Pack::A\", \"Pack::B"
"\" and so on, and each of them uses \"'Carp::Clan qw(^Pack::);'\" (or at "
"least the one in which the error or warning gets raised).\n"
"\n"
"Thus when for example your script \"tool.pl\" calls module \"Pack::A\", and "
"module \"Pack::A\" calls module \"Pack::B\", an exception raised in module "
"\"Pack::B\" will appear to have originated in \"tool.pl\" where \"Pack::A\" "
"was called, and not in \"Pack::A\" where \"Pack::B\" was called, as the "
"unmodified \"'Carp.pm'\" would try to make you believe ':-)'.\n"
"\n"
"This works similarly if \"Pack::B\" calls \"Pack::C\" where the exception is "
"raised, etcetera.\n"
"\n"
"In other words, this blames all errors in the \"'Pack::*'\" modules on the "
"user of these modules, i.e., on you. ';-)'\n"
"\n"
"The skipping of a clan (or family) of packages according to a pattern "
"describing its members is necessary in cases where these modules are not "
"classes derived from each other (and thus when examining '@ISA' - as in the "
"original \"'Carp.pm'\" module - doesn't help).\n"
"\n"
"The purpose and advantage of this is that a \"clan\" of modules can work "
"together (and call each other) and throw exceptions at various depths down "
"the calling hierarchy and still appear as a monolithic block (as though they "
"were a single module) from the perspective of the caller.\n"
"\n"
"In case you just want to ward off all error messages from the module in "
"which you \"'use Carp::Clan'\", i.e., if you want to make all error messages "
"or warnings to appear to originate from where your module was called (this "
"is what you usually used to \"'use Carp;'\" for ';-)'), instead of in your "
"module itself (which is what you can do with a \"die\" or \"warn\" anyway), "
"you do not need to provide a pattern, the module will automatically provide "
"the correct one for you.\n"
"\n"
"I.e., just \"'use Carp::Clan;'\" without any arguments and call \"carp\" or "
"\"croak\" as appropriate, and they will automatically defend your module "
"against all blames!\n"
"\n"
"In other words, a pattern is only necessary if you want to make several "
"modules (more than one) work together and appear as though they were only "
"one."

"For a number of years, I found myself re-writing this module for practically "

"    my $object = My::Module->new({ \tfile => 'myfile.html', \tmsg  => 'Hello "
"World',     }) || die My::Module->error();\n"
"\n"
"The 'new()' method handles the conversion of a list of arguments into a hash "
"array and calls the 'init()' method to perform any initialisation. In many "

"\n"
"    package My::Module;     use Class::Base;     use base qw( Class::"

"\n"
"    sub init { \tmy ($self, $config) = @_; \t \t$self->params($config, "
"qw( FOO BAR )) || return undef; \treturn $self;     }\n"
"\n"
"    \n"
"\n"
"    1;\n"
"\n"
"Then you can go right ahead and use it like this:\n"
"\n"
"    use My::Module;\n"
"\n"
"    my $object = My::Module->new( FOO => 'the foo value', \t\t\t\t  BAR => "
"'the bar value' )         || die $My::Module::ERROR;\n"
"\n"
"Despite its limitations, Class::Base can be a surprisingly useful module to "
"have lying around for those times where you just want to create a regular "
"object based on a blessed hash reference and don't want to worry too much "
"about duplicating the same old code to bless a hash, define configuration "
"values, provide an error reporting mechanism, and so on. Simply derive your "

"Method modifiers are a convenient feature from the CLOS (Common Lisp Object "

">SUPER::foo(@_)'. I for one have trouble remembering that exact invocation, "
"so my classes seldom re-dispatch to their base classes. Very bad!\n"
"\n"
"'Class::Method::Modifiers' provides three modifiers: 'before', 'around', and "
"'after'. 'before' and 'after' are run just before and after the method they "

"method. See the 'MODIFIERS' section for more details on how the particular "

"\n"
"One clear benefit of using 'Class::Method::Modifiers' is that you can define "
"multiple modifiers in a single namespace. These separate modifiers don't "
"need to know about each other. This makes top-down design easy. Have a base "
"class that provides the skeleton methods of each operation, and have plugins "

"all easily done. It deals with time as it is used in the Gregorian calendar "
"(the one currently in use) with full support for time changes due to "
"daylight saving time.\n"
"\n"
"From the very beginning, the main focus of Date::Manip has been to be able "

"* *dates*\n"

"The word date is used extensively here and is somewhat misleading. In Date::"
"Manip, a date consists of three pieces of information: a calendar date "
"(year, month, day), a time of day (hour, minute, second), and time zone "
"information. Calendar dates and times are fully handled. Time zones are "
"handled as well, but depending on how you use Date::Manip, there may be some "
"limitations as discussed below. \n"
"* *delta*\n"
"\n"
"A delta is an amount of time (i.e. the amount of time between two different "
"dates). Think of it as the duration of an event or the amount of time "
"between two dates.\n"
"\n"
"A delta refers only to an amount of time. It includes no information about a "
"starting or ending date/time. Most people will think of a delta as an amount "
"of time, but the term 'time' is already used so much in this module that I "
"didn't want to use it here in order to avoid confusion. \n"
"* *recurrence*\n"
"\n"
"A recurring event is something which occurs on a regular recurring basis. \n"
"* *holidays* and *events*\n"
"\n"
"Holidays and events are basically named dates or recurrences.\n"
"\n"
"Among other things, Date::Manip allow you to: \n"
"* ***\n"
"\n"
"Enter a date in practically any format you choose. \n"
"* ***\n"
"\n"
"Compare two dates, entered in widely different formats to determine which is "
"earlier. \n"
"* ***\n"
"\n"
"Extract any information you want from a date using a format string similar "
"to the Unix date command. \n"
"* ***\n"
"\n"
"Determine the amount of time between two dates, or add an amount of time (a "
"delta) to a date to get a second date. \n"
"* ***\n"

"12/10/95 referring to October rather than December, etc.). \n"

"This module provides code coverage metrics for Perl. Code coverage metrics "
"describe how thoroughly tests exercise code. By using Devel::Cover you can "
"discover areas of code not exercised by your tests and determine which tests "
"to create to increase coverage. Code coverage can be considered an indirect "
"measure of quality.\n"
"\n"
"Although it is still being developed, Devel::Cover is now quite stable and "
"provides many of the features to be expected in a useful coverage tool.\n"
"\n"
"Statement, branch, condition, subroutine, and pod coverage information is "
"reported. Statement and subroutine coverage data should be accurate. Branch "
"and condition coverage data should be mostly accurate too, although not "

"Coverage. If Pod::Coverage::CountParents is available it will be used "
"instead. Coverage data for other criteria are not yet collected.\n"

"The _cover_ program can be used to generate coverage reports. Devel::Cover "
"ships with a number of reports including various types of HTML output, "
"textual reports, a report to display missing coverage in the same format as "
"compilation errors and a report to display coverage information within the "
"Vim editor.\n"
"\n"
"It is possible to add annotations to reports, for example you can add a "
"column to an HTML report showing who last changed a line, as determined by "
"git blame. Some annotation modules are shipped with Devel::Cover and you can "
"easily create your own.\n"
"\n"
"The _gcov2perl_ program can be used to convert gcov files to 'Devel::Cover' "

"display your C coverage data.\n"
"\n"
"Code coverage data are collected by replacing perl ops with functions which "
"count how many times the ops are executed. These data are then mapped back "
"to reality using the B compiler modules. There is also a statement profiling "
"facility which should not be relied on. For proper profiling use Devel::"
"NYTProf. Previous versions of Devel::Cover collected coverage data by "

"In many applications it's wise to let Perl use Unicode for the strings it "
"processes. Most of the interfaces Perl has to the outside world are still "
"byte based. Programs therefore need to decode byte strings that enter the "
"program from the outside and encode them again on the way out.\n"
"\n"
"The POSIX locale system is used to specify both the language conventions "
"requested by the user and the preferred character set to consume and output. "
"The 'Encode::Locale' module looks up the charset and encoding (called a "
"CODESET in the locale jargon) and arranges for the the Encode manpage module "
"to know this encoding under the name \"locale\". It means bytes obtained "
"from the environment can be converted to Unicode strings by calling 'Encode::"
"encode(locale => $bytes)' and converted back again with 'Encode::"
"decode(locale => $string)'.\n"
"\n"
"Where file systems interfaces pass file names in and out of the program we "
"also need care. The trend is for operating systems to use a fixed file "
"encoding that don't actually depend on the locale; and this module "
"determines the most appropriate encoding for file names. The the Encode "
"manpage module will know this encoding under the name \"locale_fs\". For "
"traditional Unix systems this will be an alias to the same encoding as "
"\"locale\".\n"
"\n"
"For programs running in a terminal window (called a \"Console\" on some "
"systems) the \"locale\" encoding is usually a good choice for what to expect "
"as input and output. Some systems allows us to query the encoding set for "
"the terminal and 'Encode::Locale' will do that if available and make these "
"encodings known under the 'Encode' aliases \"console_in\" and \"console_out"
"\". For systems where we can't determine the terminal encoding these will be "
"aliased as the same encoding as \"locale\". The advice is to use \"console_in"
"\" for input known to come from the terminal and \"console_out\" for output "
"to the terminal.\n"
"\n"
"In addition to arranging for various Encode aliases the following functions "
"and variables are provided: \n"
"* decode_argv( ) \n"
"* decode_argv( Encode::FB_CROAK )\n"
"\n"
"  This will decode the command line arguments to perl (the '@ARGV' array)   "
"in-place.\n"
"\n"
"  The function will by default replace characters that can't be decoded by   "
"\"\\x{FFFD}\", the Unicode replacement character.\n"
"\n"
"  Any argument provided is passed as CHECK to underlying Encode::decode()   "
"call. Pass the value 'Encode::FB_CROAK' to have the decoding croak if not   "
"all the command line arguments can be decoded. See the Encode/\"Handling   "
"Malformed Data\" manpage for details on other options for CHECK. \n"
"* env( $uni_key ) \n"
"* env( $uni_key => $uni_value )\n"
"\n"
"  Interface to get/set environment variables. Returns the current value as   "
"a Unicode string. The $uni_key and $uni_value arguments are expected to   be "
"Unicode strings as well. Passing 'undef' as $uni_value deletes the   "
"environment variable named $uni_key.\n"
"\n"
"  The returned value will have the characters that can't be decoded   "
"replaced by \"\\x{FFFD}\", the Unicode replacement character.\n"
"\n"
"  There is no interface to request alternative CHECK behavior as for   "
"decode_argv(). If you need that you need to call encode/decode yourself.   "
"For example:\n"
"\n"
"      my $key = Encode::encode(locale => $uni_key, Encode::FB_CROAK);       "
"my $uni_value = Encode::decode(locale => $ENV{$key}, Encode::FB_CROAK); \n"
"* reinit( ) \n"
"* reinit( $encoding )\n"
"\n"
"  Reinitialize the encodings from the locale. You want to call this   "
"function if you changed anything in the environment that might influence   "
"the locale.\n"
"\n"
"  This function will croak if the determined encoding isn't recognized by   "
"the Encode module.\n"
"\n"
"  With argument force $ENCODING_... variables to set to the given value. \n"
"* $ENCODING_LOCALE\n"
"\n"
"  The encoding name determined to be suitable for the current locale. the   "
"Encode manpage know this encoding as \"locale\". \n"
"* $ENCODING_LOCALE_FS\n"
"\n"

"ALERT: Marc Lehmann may have taken over the future of event loops in Perl. "
"Check out his libev library and EV Perl module. 25 Aug 2009\n"
"\n"
"The Event module provide a central facility to watch for various types of "
"events and invoke a callback when these events occur. The idea is to delay "
"the handling of events so that they may be dispatched in priority order when "
"it is safe for callbacks to execute.\n"
"\n"
"Events (in the ordinary sense of the word) are detected by *watchers*, which "
"reify them as *events* (in the special Event module sense). For clarity, the "
"former type of events may be called \"source events\", and the latter "
"\"target events\". Source events, such as signals arriving, happen whether "
"or not they are being watched. If a source event occurs which a watcher is "
"actively watching then the watcher generates a corresponding target event. "
"Target events are only created by watchers. If several watchers are "
"interested in the same source event then each will generate their own target "
"event. Hence, any particular source event may result in zero, one, two, or "
"any number of target events: the same as the number of watchers which were "
"actively watching for it.\n"
"\n"
"Target events are queued to be processed in priority order (priority being "
"determined by the creating watcher) and in FIFO order among events of the "
"same priority. Queued (\"pending\") events can, in some cases, be cancelled "
"before being processed. A queued event is processed by being passed to the "
"callback function (or method on a particular object or class) which was "
"specified to the watcher.\n"
"\n"
"A watcher, once created, operates autonomously without the Event user having "
"to retain any reference to it. However, keeping a reference makes it "
"possible to modify most of the watcher's characteristics. A watcher can be "
"switched between active and inactive states. When inactive, it does not "
"generate target events.\n"
"\n"
"Some types of source event are not reified as target events immediately. "
"Signals received, for example, are counted initially. The counted signals "
"are reified at certain execution points. Hence, signal events may be "
"processed out of order, and if handled carelessly, on the wrong side of a "
"state change in event handling. A useful way to view this is that occurrence "
"of the source event is not actually the arrival of the signal but is "
"triggered by the counting of the signal.\n"
"\n"
"Reification can be forced when necessary. The schedule on which some other "
"events are created is non-obvious. This is especially the case with watchers "
"that watch for a condition rather than an event. In some cases, target "
"events are generated on a schedule that depends on the operation of the "
"event loop."

"locations are determined from the ExtUtils::Config manpage, and they may be "
"individually overridden by using the 'install_path' attribute. An "
"'install_base' attribute lets you specify an alternative installation root "
"like _/home/foo_ and 'prefix' does something similar in a rather different "
"(and more complicated) way. 'destdir' lets you specify a temporary "
"installation directory like _/tmp/install_ in case you want to create "
"bundled-up installable packages.\n"

"File locking in Perl is usually done using the 'flock' function. "
"Unfortunately, this only allows locks on whole files and is often "

"some shortcomings (especially concerning locks on remotely mounted file "
"systems) and slightly different behaviour than the fcntl(2) manpage.\n"
"\n"
"Using this module file locking via the fcntl(2) manpage can be done "
"(obviously, this restricts the use of the module to systems that have a the "
"fcntl(2) manpage system call). Before a file (or parts of a file) can be "
"locked, an object simulating a flock structure, containing information in a "
"binary format to be passed to the fcntl(2) manpage for locking requests, "
"must be created and its properties set. Afterwards, by calling the the "
"lock() manpage method a lock can be set and removed or it can be determined "
"if and which process currently holds the lock.\n"
"\n"
"File::FcntlLock (or its alias File::FcntlLock::XS) uses a shared library, "

"instead and use Perl code to assemble and disassemble the structure. For "
"this at some time the (system-dependent) binary layout of the flock "

"difference between File::FcntlLock::Pure and File::FcntlLock::Inline is that "

"latter it is done each time the package is loaded (e.g., with 'use'). Thus, "
"for File::FcntlLock::Inline to work a C compiler must be available. There "

"'File::Find' is great, but constructing the 'wanted' routine can sometimes "
"be a pain. This module provides a 'wanted'-writer, using syntax that is "
"directly mappable to the _find_ command's syntax.\n"
"\n"
"Also, I find myself (heh) frequently just wanting the list of names that "
"match. With 'File::Find', I have to write a little accumulator, and then "
"access that from a closure. But with 'File::Finder', I can turn the problem "
"inside out.\n"
"\n"
"A 'File::Finder' object contains a hash of 'File::Find' options, and a "
"series of steps that mimic _find_'s predicates. Initially, a 'File::Finder' "
"object has no steps. Each step method clones the previous object's options "
"and steps, and then adds the new step, returning the new object. In this "
"manner, an object can be grown, step by step, by chaining method calls. "
"Furthermore, a partial sequence can be created and held, and used as the "
"head of many different sequences.\n"
"\n"
"For example, a step sequence that finds only files looks like:\n"
"\n"
"  my $files = File::Finder->type('f');\n"
"\n"
"Here, 'type' is acting as a class method and thus a constructor. An instance "
"of 'File::Finder' is returned, containing the one step to verify that only "
"files are selected. We could use this immediately as a 'File::Find::find' "
"wanted routine, although it'd be uninteresting:\n"
"\n"
"  use File::Find;   find($files, \"/tmp\");\n"
"\n"
"Calling a step method on an existing object adds the step, returning the new "
"object:\n"
"\n"
"  my $files_print = $files->print;\n"
"\n"
"And now if we use this with 'find', we get a nice display:\n"
"\n"
"  find($files_print, \"/tmp\");\n"
"\n"
"Of course, we didn't really need that second object: we could have generated "
"it on the fly:\n"
"\n"
"  find($files->print, \"/tmp\");\n"
"\n"
"'File::Find' supports options to modify behavior, such as depth-first "
"searching. The 'depth' step flags this in the options as well:\n"
"\n"
"  my $files_depth_print = $files->depth->print;\n"
"\n"
"However, the 'File::Finder' object needs to be told explictly to generate an "
"options hash for 'File::Find::find' to pass this information along:\n"
"\n"
"  find($files_depth_print->as_options, \"/tmp\");\n"
"\n"
"A 'File::Finder' object, like the _find_ command, supports AND, OR, NOT, and "
"parenthesized sub-expressions. AND binds tighter than OR, and is also "
"implied everywhere that it makes sense. Like _find_, the predicates are "
"computed in a \"short-circuit\" fashion, so that a false to the left of the "
"(implied) AND keeps the right side from being evaluated, including entire "
"parenthesized subexpressions. Similarly, if the left side of an OR is false, "
"the right side is evaluated, and if the left side of the OR is true, the "
"right side is skipped. Nested parens are handled properly. Parens are "
"indicated with the rather ugly 'left' and 'right' methods:\n"
"\n"
"  my $big_or_old_files = $files->left->size(\"+50\")->or->atime(\"+30\")-"
">right;\n"
"\n"
"The parens here correspond directly to the parens in:\n"
"\n"
"  find somewhere -type f '(' -size +50 -o -atime +30 ')'\n"
"\n"
"and are needed so that the OR and the implied ANDs have the right nesting.\n"
"\n"
"Besides passing the constructed 'File::Finder' object to 'File::Finder::"
"find' directly as a 'wanted' routine or an options hash, you can also call "
"'find' implictly, with 'in'. 'in' provides a list of starting points, and "
"returns all filenames that match the criteria.\n"
"\n"
"For example, a list of all names in /tmp can be generated simply with:\n"
"\n"
" my @names = File::Finder->in(\"/tmp\");\n"
"\n"
"For more flexibility, use 'collect' to execute an arbitrary block in a list "
"context, concatenating all the results (similar to 'map'):\n"
"\n"
"  my %sizes = File::Finder     ->collect(sub { $File::Find::name => -s _ }, "
"\"/tmp\");\n"
"\n"

"Some futures represent a single operation and are explicitly marked as ready "

"Other futures represent a collection of sub-tasks, and are implicitly marked "

"*Getopt::Tabular* is a Perl 5 module for table-driven argument parsing, "
"vaguely inspired by John Ousterhout's Tk_ParseArgv. All you really need to "
"do to use the package is set up a table describing all your command-line "
"options, and call &GetOptions with three arguments: a reference to your "
"option table, a reference to '@ARGV' (or something like it), and an optional "
"third array reference (say, to '@newARGV'). &GetOptions will process all "
"arguments in '@ARGV', and copy any leftover arguments (i.e. those that are "
"not options or arguments to some option) to the '@newARGV' array. (If the "
"'@newARGV' argument is not supplied, 'GetOptions' will replace '@ARGV' with "
"the stripped-down argument list.) If there are any invalid options, "
"'GetOptions' will print an error message and return 0.\n"
"\n"
"Before I tell you all about why Getopt::Tabular is a wonderful thing, let me "
"explain some of the terminology that will keep popping up here. \n"
"* argument\n"
"\n"
"  any single word appearing on the command-line, i.e. one element of the   "
"'@ARGV' array. \n"
"* option\n"
"\n"
"  an argument that starts with a certain sequence of characters; the   "
"default is \"-\". (If you like GNU-style options, you can change this to   "
"\"--\".) In most Getopt::Tabular-based applications, options can come   "
"anywhere on the command line, and their order is unimportant (unless one   "
"option overrides a previous option). Also, Getopt::Tabular will allow any   "
"non-ambiguous abbreviation of options. \n"
"* option argument\n"
"\n"
"  (or _value_) an argument that immediately follows certain types of   "
"options. For instance, if '-foo' is a scalar-valued integer option, and   '-"
"foo 3' appears on the command line, then '3' will be the argument to   '-"
"foo'. \n"
"* option type\n"
"\n"
"  controls how 'GetOptions' deals with an option and the arguments that   "
"follow it. (Actually, for most option types, the type interacts with the   "
"'num_values' field, which determines whether the option is scalar- or   "
"vector-valued. This will be fully explained in due course.)"

"*** Although documentation in this file provides some overview, it is mainly "
"intended for API documentation. See HTML::FormHandler::Manual::Intro for an "
"introduction, with links to other documentation.\n"
"\n"
"HTML::FormHandler maintains a clean separation between form construction and "
"form rendering. It allows you to define your forms and fields in a number of "
"flexible ways. Although it provides renderers for HTML, you can define "
"custom renderers for any kind of presentation.\n"
"\n"
"HTML::FormHandler allows you to define form fields and validators. It can be "
"used for both database and non-database forms, and will automatically update "
"or create rows in a database. It can be used to process structured data that "
"doesn't come from an HTML form.\n"
"\n"
"One of its goals is to keep the controller/application program interface as "
"simple as possible, and to minimize the duplication of code. In most cases, "
"interfacing your controller to your form is only a few lines of code.\n"
"\n"
"With FormHandler you shouldn't have to spend hours trying to figure out how "
"to make a simple HTML change that would take one minute by hand. Because you "
"_can_ do it by hand. Or you can automate HTML generation as much as you "
"want, with template widgets or pure Perl rendering classes, and stay "
"completely in control of what, where, and how much is done automatically. "
"You can define custom renderers and display your rendered forms however you "
"want.\n"
"\n"
"You can split the pieces of your forms up into logical parts and compose "
"complete forms from FormHandler classes, roles, fields, collections of "
"validations, transformations and Moose type constraints. You can write "
"custom methods to process forms, add any attribute you like, and use Moose "
"method modifiers. FormHandler forms are Perl classes, so there's a lot of "
"flexibility in what you can do.\n"
"\n"
"HTML::FormHandler provides rendering through roles which are applied to form "
"and field classes (although there's no reason you couldn't write a renderer "
"as an external object either). There are currently two flavors: all-in-one "
"solutions like HTML::FormHandler::Render::Simple and HTML::FormHandler::"
"Render::Table that contain methods for rendering field widget classes, and "
"the HTML::FormHandler::Widget roles, which are more atomic roles which are "
"automatically applied to fields and form. See HTML::FormHandler::Manual::"
"Rendering for more details. (And you can easily use hand-built forms - "
"FormHandler doesn't care.)\n"
"\n"
"The typical application for FormHandler would be in a Catalyst, DBIx::Class, "
"Template Toolkit web application, but use is not limited to that. "
"FormHandler can be used in any Perl application.\n"
"\n"
"More Formhandler documentation and a tutorial can be found in the manual at "
"HTML::FormHandler::Manual."

msgid ""
"HTML::TableExtract is a subclass of HTML::Parser that serves to extract the "
"information from tables of interest contained within an HTML document. The "
"information from each extracted table is stored in table objects. Tables can "
"be extracted as text, HTML, or HTML::ElementTable structures (for in-place "
"editing or manipulation).\n"
"\n"
"There are currently four constraints available to specify which tables you "
"would like to extract from a document: _Headers_, _Depth_, _Count_, and "
"_Attributes_.\n"
"\n"
"_Headers_, the most flexible and adaptive of the techniques, involves "
"specifying text in an array that you expect to appear above the data in the "
"tables of interest. Once all headers have been located in a row of that "
"table, all further cells beneath the columns that matched your headers are "
"extracted. All other columns are ignored: think of it as vertical slices "
"through a table. In addition, TableExtract automatically rearranges each row "
"in the same order as the headers you provided. If you would like to disable "
"this, set _automap_ to 0 during object creation, and instead rely on the "
"column_map() method to find out the order in which the headers were found. "
"Furthermore, TableExtract will automatically compensate for cell span issues "
"so that columns are really the same columns as you would visually see in a "
"browser. This behavior can be disabled by setting the _gridmap_ parameter to "
"0. HTML is stripped from the entire textual content of a cell before header "
"matches are attempted -- unless the _keep_html_ parameter was enabled.\n"
"\n"
"_Depth_ and _Count_ are more specific ways to specify tables in relation to "
"one another. _Depth_ represents how deeply a table resides in other tables. "
"The depth of a top-level table in the document is 0. A table within a top-"
"level table has a depth of 1, and so on. Each depth can be thought of as a "
"layer; tables sharing the same depth are on the same layer. Within each of "
"these layers, _Count_ represents the order in which a table was seen at that "
"depth, starting with 0. Providing both a _depth_ and a _count_ will uniquely "
"specify a table within a document.\n"
"\n"
"_Attributes_ match based on the attributes of the html <table> tag, for "
"example, border widths or background color.\n"
"\n"
"Each of the _Headers_, _Depth_, _Count_, and _Attributes_ specifications are "
"cumulative in their effect on the overall extraction. For instance, if you "
"specify only a _Depth_, then you get all tables at that depth (note that "
"these could very well reside in separate higher- level tables throughout the "
"document since depth extends across tables). If you specify only a _Count_, "
"then the tables at that _Count_ from all depths are returned (i.e., the "
"_n_th occurrence of a table at each depth). If you only specify _Headers_, "
"then you get all tables in the document containing those column headers. If "
"you have specified multiple constraints of _Headers_, _Depth_, _Count_, and "
"_Attributes_, then each constraint has veto power over whether a particular "
"table is extracted.\n"
"\n"
"If no _Headers_, _Depth_, _Count_, or _Attributes_ are specified, then all "
"tables match.\n"
"\n"
"When extracting only text from tables, the text is decoded with HTML::"
"Entities by default; this can be disabled by setting the _decode_ parameter "
"to 0."

"This module is meant to be the definitive implementation of iterators, as "
"popularized by Mark Jason Dominus's lectures and recent book (_Higher Order "
"Perl_, Morgan Kauffman, 2005).\n"
"\n"
"An \"iterator\" is an object, represented as a code block that generates the "
"\"next value\" of a sequence, and generally implemented as a closure. When "
"you need a value to operate on, you pull it from the iterator. If it depends "
"on other iterators, it pulls values from them when it needs to. Iterators "
"can be chained together (see the Iterator::Util manpage for functions that "
"help you do just that), queueing up work to be done but _not actually doing "
"it_ until a value is needed at the front end of the chain. At that time, one "
"data value is pulled through the chain.\n"
"\n"
"Contrast this with ordinary array processing, where you load or compute all "
"of the input values at once, then loop over them in memory. It's analogous "
"to the difference between looping over a file one line at a time, and "
"reading the entire file into an array of lines before operating on it.\n"
"\n"
"Iterator.pm provides a class that simplifies creation and use of these "
"iterator objects. Other 'Iterator::' modules (see the /\"SEE ALSO\" manpage) "
"provide many general-purpose and special-purpose iterator functions.\n"
"\n"
"Some iterators are infinite (that is, they generate infinite sequences), and "
"some are finite. When the end of a finite sequence is reached, the iterator "
"code block should throw an exception of the type 'Iterator::X::"
"Am_Now_Exhausted'; this is usually done via the the /is_done manpage "
"function.. This will signal the Iterator class to mark the object as "
"exhausted. The the /is_exhausted manpage method will then return true, and "
"the the /isnt_exhausted manpage method will return false. Any further calls "
"to the the /value manpage method will throw an exception of the type "
"'Iterator::X::Exhausted'. See the /DIAGNOSTICS manpage.\n"
"\n"
"Note that in many, many cases, you will not need to explicitly create an "
"iterator; there are plenty of iterator generation and manipulation functions "
"in the other associated modules. You can just plug them together like "

msgid ""
"This module works around two historical bugs in Perl's handling of the "
"'%^H' (lexical hints) variable. One bug causes lexical state in one file to "
"leak into another that is 'require'd/'use'd from it. This bug, [perl\n"
"\n"
"The second bug causes lexical state (normally a blank '%^H' once the first "
"bug is fixed) to leak outwards from 'utf8.pm', if it is automatically loaded "
"during Unicode regular expression matching, into whatever source is "
"compiling at the time of the regexp match. This bug, [perl #73174], was "
"present from Perl 5.8.7 up to Perl 5.11.5, fixed in Perl 5.12.0.\n"
"\n"
"Both of these bugs seriously damage the usability of any module relying on "
"'%^H' for lexical scoping, on the affected Perl versions. It is in practice "
"essential to work around these bugs when using such modules. On versions of "
"Perl that require such a workaround, this module globally changes the "
"behaviour of 'require', including 'use' and the implicit 'require' performed "
"in Unicode regular expression matching, so that it no longer exhibits these "
"bugs.\n"
"\n"
"The workaround supplied by this module takes effect the first time its "
"'import' method is called. Typically this will be done by means of a 'use' "
"statement. This should be done as early as possible, because it only affects "
"'require'/'use' statements that are compiled after the workaround goes into "
"effect. For 'use' statements, and 'require' statements that are executed "
"immediately and only once, it suffices to invoke the workaround when loading "
"the first module that will set up vulnerable lexical state. Delayed-action "
"'require' statements, however, are more troublesome, and can require the "
"workaround to be loaded much earlier. Ultimately, an affected Perl program "
"may need to load the workaround as very nearly its first action. Invoking "
"this module multiple times, from multiple modules, is not a problem: the "
"workaround is only applied once, and applies to everything subsequently "
"compiled.\n"
"\n"
"This module is implemented in XS, with a pure Perl backup version for "
"systems that can't handle XS modules. The XS version has a better chance of "
"playing nicely with other modules that modify 'require' handling. The pure "
"Perl version can't work at all on some Perl versions; users of those "
"versions must use the XS. On all Perl versions suffering the underlying hint "
"leakage bug, pure Perl hooking of 'require' breaks the use of 'require' "
"without an explicit parameter (implicitly using '$_')."

"'Log::Any' provides a standard log production API for modules. Log::Any::"
"Adapter allows applications to choose the mechanism for log consumption, "

"Log4perl.\n"
"\n"
"Many modules have something interesting to say. Unfortunately there is no "
"standard way for them to say it - some output to STDERR, others to 'warn', "
"others to custom file logs. And there is no standard way to get a module to "
"start talking - sometimes you must call a uniquely named method, other times "

"\n"
"This being Perl, there are many logging mechanisms available on CPAN. Each "

"makes it difficult for a CPAN author to commit his/her users to one of them. "
"This may be why many CPAN modules invent their own logging or choose not to "
"log at all.\n"
"\n"
"To untangle this situation, we must separate the two parts of a logging API. "
"The first, _log production_, includes methods to output logs (like '$log-"
">debug') and methods to inspect whether a log level is activated (like '$log-"
">is_debug'). This is generally all that CPAN modules care about. The second, "
"_log consumption_, includes a way to configure where logging goes (a file, "
"the screen, etc.) and the code to send it there. This choice generally "
"belongs to the application.\n"
"\n"
"A CPAN module uses 'Log::Any' to get a log producer object. An application, "
"in turn, may choose one or more logging mechanisms via Log::Any::Adapter, or "
"none at all.\n"
"\n"
"'Log::Any' has a very tiny footprint and no dependencies beyond Perl 5.8.1, "
"which makes it appropriate for even small CPAN modules to use. It defaults "

"MetaRole manpage in a the Moose::Exporter manpage-based package. the MooseX::"
"NonMoose::Meta::Role::Class manpage is the part that provides the main "
"functionality of this module; if you don't care about inlining, this is all "

"Sort::Versions allows easy sorting of mixed non-numeric and numeric strings, "
"like the 'version numbers' that many shared library systems and revision "
"control packages use. This is quite useful if you are trying to deal with "
"shared libraries. It can also be applied to applications that intersperse "
"variable-width numeric fields within text. Other applications can "
"undoubtedly be found.\n"
"\n"
"For an explanation of the algorithm, it's simplest to look at these "

"\n"
"  1.1   <  1.2   1.1a  <  1.2   1.1   <  1.1.1   1.1   <  1.1a   1.1.a <  "

"used. A group or subgroup with more units will win if all comparisons are "
"equal. A period binds digit groups together more tightly than a hyphen.\n"
"\n"
"Some packages use a different style of version numbering: a simple real "
"number written as a decimal. Sort::Versions has limited support for this "

"This won39t always work, because there won39t always be a leading zero in "
"real-number style version numbers. There is no way for Sort::Versions to "
"know which style was intended. But a lot of the time it will do the right "
"thing. If you are making up version numbers, the style with (possibly) more "

msgid ""
"\"Spiffy\" is a framework and methodology for doing object oriented (OO) "
"programming in Perl. Spiffy combines the best parts of Exporter.pm, base.pm, "
"mixin.pm and SUPER.pm into one magic foundation class. It attempts to fix "
"all the nits and warts of traditional Perl OO, in a clean, straightforward "
"and (perhaps someday) standard way.\n"
"\n"
"Spiffy borrows ideas from other OO languages like Python, Ruby, Java and "
"Perl 6. It also adds a few tricks of its own.\n"
"\n"
"If you take a look on CPAN, there are a ton of OO related modules. When "
"starting a new project, you need to pick the set of modules that makes most "
"sense, and then you need to use those modules in each of your classes. "
"Spiffy, on the other hand, has everything you'll probably need in one "
"module, and you only need to use it once in one of your classes. If you make "
"Spiffy.pm the base class of the basest class in your project, Spiffy will "
"automatically pass all of its magic to all of your subclasses. You may "
"eventually forget that you're even using it!\n"
"\n"
"The most striking difference between Spiffy and other Perl object oriented "
"base classes, is that it has the ability to export things. If you create a "
"subclass of Spiffy, all the things that Spiffy exports will automatically be "
"exported by your subclass, in addition to any more things that you want to "
"export. And if someone creates a subclass of your subclass, all of those "
"things will be exported automatically, and so on. Think of it as \"Inherited "
"Exportation\", and it uses the familiar Exporter.pm specification syntax.\n"
"\n"
"To use Spiffy or any subclass of Spiffy as a base class of your class, you "
"specify the '-base' argument to the 'use' command.\n"
"\n"
"    use MySpiffyBaseModule -base;\n"
"\n"
"You can also use the traditional 'use base 'MySpiffyBaseModule';' syntax and "
"everything will work exactly the same. The only caveat is that Spiffy.pm "
"must already be loaded. That's because Spiffy rewires base.pm on the fly to "
"do all the Spiffy magics.\n"
"\n"
"Spiffy has support for Ruby-like mixins with Perl6-like roles. Just like "
"'base' you can use either of the following invocations:\n"
"\n"
"    use mixin 'MySpiffyBaseModule';     use MySpiffyBaseModule -mixin;\n"
"\n"
"The second version will only work if the class being mixed in is a subclass "
"of Spiffy. The first version will work in all cases, as long as Spiffy has "
"already been loaded.\n"
"\n"
"To limit the methods that get mixed in, use roles. (Hint: they work just "
"like an Exporter list):\n"
"\n"
"    use MySpiffyBaseModule -mixin => qw(:basics x y !foo);\n"
"\n"
"In object oriented Perl almost every subroutine is a method. Each method "
"gets the object passed to it as its first argument. That means practically "
"every subroutine starts with the line:\n"
"\n"
"    my $self = shift;\n"
"\n"
"Spiffy provides a simple, optional filter mechanism to insert that line for "
"you, resulting in cleaner code. If you figure an average method has 10 lines "
"of code, that's 10% of your code! To turn this option on, you just use the "
"'- Base' option instead of the '-base' option, or add the '-selfless' "
"option. If source filtering makes you queazy, don't use the feature. I "
"personally find it addictive in my quest for writing squeaky clean, "
"maintainable code.\n"
"\n"
"A useful feature of Spiffy is that it exports two functions: 'field' and "
"'const' that can be used to declare the attributes of your class, and "
"automatically generate accessor methods for them. The only difference "
"between the two functions is that 'const' attributes can not be modified; "
"thus the accessor is much faster.\n"
"\n"
"One interesting aspect of OO programming is when a method calls the same "
"method from a parent class. This is generally known as calling a super "
"method. Perl's facility for doing this is butt ugly:\n"
"\n"
"    sub cleanup {         my $self = shift;         $self->scrub;         "
"$self->SUPER::cleanup(@_);     }\n"
"\n"
"Spiffy makes it, er, super easy to call super methods. You just use the "
"'super' function. You don't need to pass it any arguments because it "
"automatically passes them on for you. Here's the same function with Spiffy:\n"
"\n"
"    sub cleanup {         $self->scrub;         super;     }\n"
"\n"
"Spiffy has a special method for parsing arguments called 'parse_arguments', "
"that it also uses for parsing its own arguments. You declare which arguments "
"are boolean (singletons) and which ones are paired, with two special methods "
"called 'boolean_arguments' and 'paired_arguments'. Parse arguments pulls out "
"the booleans and pairs and returns them in an anonymous hash, followed by a "
"list of the unmatched arguments.\n"
"\n"
"Finally, Spiffy can export a few debugging functions 'WWW', 'XXX', 'YYY' and "
"'ZZZ'. Each of them produces a YAML dump of its arguments. WWW warns the "
"output, XXX dies with the output, YYY prints the output, and ZZZ confesses "
"the output. If YAML doesn't suit your needs, you can switch all the dumps to "
"Data::Dumper format with the '-dumper' option.\n"
"\n"
"That's Spiffy!"

"The Switch.pm module implements a generalized case mechanism that covers "
"most (but not all) of the numerous possible combinations of switch and case "
"values described above.\n"
"\n"
"The module augments the standard Perl syntax with two new control "
"statements: 'switch' and 'case'. The 'switch' statement takes a single "
"scalar argument of any type, specified in parentheses. 'switch' stores this "
"value as the current switch value in a (localized) control variable. The "
"value is followed by a block which may contain one or more Perl statements "
"(including the 'case' statement described below). The block is "
"unconditionally executed once the switch value has been cached.\n"
"\n"
"A 'case' statement takes a single scalar argument (in mandatory parentheses "
"if it's a variable; otherwise the parens are optional) and selects the "
"appropriate type of matching between that argument and the current switch "
"value. The type of matching used is determined by the respective types of "
"the switch value and the 'case' argument, as specified in Table 1. If the "
"match is successful, the mandatory block associated with the 'case' "
"statement is executed.\n"
"\n"
"In most other respects, the 'case' statement is semantically identical to an "
"'if' statement. For example, it can be followed by an 'else' clause, and can "
"be used as a postfix statement qualifier.\n"
"\n"
"However, when a 'case' block has been executed control is automatically "
"transferred to the statement after the immediately enclosing 'switch' block, "
"rather than to the next statement within the block. In other words, the "
"success of any 'case' statement prevents other cases in the same scope from "
"executing. But see the \"Allowing fall-through\" manpage below.\n"

"Together these two new statements provide a fully generalized case "
"mechanism:\n"

msgid ""
"Prior to version 5.8.0 perl implemented 'unsafe' signal handling. The reason "
"it is consider unsafe, is that there is a risk that a signal will arrive, "
"and be handled while perl is changing internal data structures. This can "
"result in all kinds of subtle and not so subtle problems. For this reason it "
"has always been recommended that one do as little as possible in a signal "
"handler, and only variables that already exist be manipulated.\n"
"\n"
"Perl 5.8.0 and later versions implements 'safe' signal handling on platforms "
"which support the POSIX sigaction() function. This is accomplished by having "
"perl note that a signal has arrived, but deferring the execution of the "
"signal handler until such time as it is safe to do so. Unfortunately these "
"changes can break some existing scripts, if they depended on a system "
"routine being interrupted by the signal's arrival. The perl 5.8.0 "
"implementation was modified further in version 5.8.2.\n"
"\n"
"From the perl 5.8.2 *perlvar* man page:\n"
"\n"
"   The default delivery policy of signals changed in Perl 5.8.0    from "
"immediate (also known as \"unsafe\") to deferred, also    known as \"safe "
"signals\".\n"
"\n"
"The implementation of this changed the 'sa_flags' with which the signal "
"handler is installed by perl, and it causes some system routines (like "
"connect()) to return EINTR, instead of another error when the signal "
"arrives. The problem comes when the code that made the system call sees the "
"EINTR code and decides it's going to call it again before returning. Perl "
"doesn't do this but some libraries do, including for instance, the Oracle "
"OCI library.\n"
"\n"
"Thus the 'deferred signal' approach (as implemented by default in perl 5.8 "
"and later) results in some system calls being retried prior to the signal "
"handler being called by perl. This breaks timeout logic for DBD-Oracle which "
"works with earlier versions of perl. This can be particularly vexing, when, "
"for instance, the host on which a database resides is not available: 'DBI-"
">connect()' hangs for minutes before returning an error (and cannot even be "
"interrupted with control-C, even when the intended timeout is only seconds). "
"This is because SIGINT appears to be deferred as well. The result is that it "
"is impossible to implement open timeouts with code that looks like this in "
"perl 5.8.0 and later:\n"
"\n"
"   eval {       eval {          local $SIG{ALRM} = sub { die \"timeout"
"\" };          alarm 2;          $sth = DBI->connect(...);          alarm "
"0;       };       alarm 0;       die if $@;    };\n"
"\n"
"Or as the author of bug #50628 pointed out, might probably better be written "
"as:\n"
"\n"
"   eval {       local $SIG{ALRM} = sub { die \"timeout\" };       eval "
"{          alarm 2;          $sth = DBI->connect(...);          alarm "
"0;       };       alarm 0;       die if $@;    };\n"
"\n"
"The solution, if your system has the POSIX sigaction() function, is to use "
"perl's 'POSIX::sigaction()' to install the signal handler. With "
"'sigaction()', one gets control over both the signal mask, and the "
"'sa_flags' that are used to install the handler. Further, with perl 5.8.2 "
"and later, a 'safe' switch is provided which can be used to ask for safe(r) "
"signal handling.\n"
"\n"
"Using sigaction() ensures that the system call won't be resumed after it's "
"interrupted, so long as die is called within the signal handler. This is no "
"longer the case when one uses '$SIG{name}' to set signal handlers in perls "
">= 5.8.0.\n"
"\n"
"The usage of sigaction() is not well documented however, and in perl "
"versions less than 5.8.0, it does not work at all. (But that's OK, because "
"just setting '$SIG' does work in that case.) Using sigaction() requires "
"approximately 4 or 5 lines of code where previously one only had to set a "
"code reference into the %SIG hash.\n"
"\n"
"Unfortunately, at least with perl 5.8.0, the result is that doing this "
"effectively reverts to the 'unsafe' signals behavior. It is not clear "
"whether this would be the case in perl 5.8.2, since the safe flag can be "
"used to ask for safe signal handling. I suspect this separates the logic "
"which uses the 'sa_flags' to install the handler, and whether deferred "
"signal handling is used.\n"
"\n"
"The reader should also note, that the behavior of the 'safe' attribute is "
"not consistent with what this author expected. Specifically, it appears to "
"disable signal masking. This can be examined further in the t/safe.t and the "
"t/mask.t regression tests. Never-the-less, Sys::SigAction provides an easy "
"mechanism for the user to recover the pre-5.8.0 behavior for signal "
"handling, and the mask attribute clearly works. (see t/mask.t) If one is "
"looking for specific safe signal handling behavior that is considered "
"broken, and the breakage can be demonstrated, then a patch to t/safe.t would "
"be most welcome.\n"
"\n"
"This module wraps up the POSIX:: routines and objects necessary to call "
"sigaction() in a way that is as efficient from a coding perspective as just "
"setting a localized '$SIG{SIGNAL}' with a code reference. Further, the user "
"has control over the 'sa_flags' passed to sigaction(). By default, if no "
"additional args are passed to sigaction(), then the signal handler will be "
"called when a signal (such as SIGALRM) is delivered.\n"
"\n"
"Since sigaction() is not fully functional in perl versions less than 5.8, "
"this module implements equivalent behavior using the standard '%SIG' array. "
"The version checking and implementation of the 'right' code is handled by "
"this module, so the user does not have to write perl version dependent code. "
"The attrs hashref argument to set_sig_handler() is silently ignored, in perl "
"versions less than 5.8. When this module was developed it was tested on perl "
"5.005 on solaris. That was in 2004. Now only perl versions >= 5.6 are "
"supported. If you want this to work on perl 5.5 you will have comment out "
"\"use warnings\" everywhere.\n"
"\n"
"It is hoped that with the use of this module, your signal handling behavior "
"can be coded in a way that does not change from one perl version to the "
"next, and that sigaction() will be easier for you to use."

"Testing is usually the ugly part of Perl module authoring. Perl gives you a "

"  throws_ok BLOCK REGEX, TEST_DESCRIPTION   throws_ok BLOCK CLASS, "

"In the first form the test passes if the stringified exception matches the "

"    throws_ok { read_file( 'unreadable' ) } qr/No file/, 'no file';\n"

"\n"
"The second form of throws_ok() test passes if the exception is of the same "
"class as the one supplied, or a subclass of that class. For example:\n"
"\n"
"    throws_ok { $foo->bar } \"Error::Simple\", 'simple error';\n"
"\n"
"Will only pass if the 'bar' method throws an Error::Simple exception, or a "

"    my $SIMPLE = Error::Simple->new;     throws_ok { $foo->bar } $SIMPLE, "
"'simple error';\n"

"This module provides a simple (yet full featured) interface to LectroTest, "
"an automated, specification-based testing system for Perl. To use it, "
"declare properties that specify the expected behavior of your software. "
"LectroTest then checks your software to see whether those properties hold.\n"
"\n"
"Declare properties using the 'Property' function, which takes a block of "
"code and promotes it to a Test::LectroTest::Property:\n"
"\n"
"    Property {                  MyModule::my_function( $x, $y ) >= 0;     }, "
"name => \"my_function output is non-negative\" ;\n"
"\n"
"The first part of the block must contain a generator-binding declaration. "
"For example:\n"
"\n"
"        \n"
"\n"
"(Note the special bracketing, which is required.) This particular binding "
"says, \"For all integers _x_ and _y_.\" (By the way, you aren't limited to "
"integers. LectroTest also gives you booleans, strings, lists, hashes, and "
"more, and it lets you define your own generator types. See Test::LectroTest::"
"Generator for more.)\n"
"\n"
"The second part of the block is simply a snippet of code that makes use of "
"the variables we bound earlier to test whether a property holds for the "
"piece of software we are testing:\n"
"\n"
"        MyModule::my_function( $x, $y ) >= 0;\n"
"\n"
"In this case, it asserts that 'MyModule::my_function($x,$y)' returns a non-"
"negative result. (Yes, '$x' and '$y' refer to the same _x_ and _y_ that we "
"bound to the generators earlier. LectroTest automagically loads these "
"lexically bound Perl variables with values behind the scenes.) \n"
"*Note:* If you want to use testing assertions like 'ok' from Test::Simple or "
"'is', 'like', or 'cmp_ok' from Test::More (and the related family of Test::"
"Builder-based testing modules), see Test::LectroTest::Compat, which lets you "
"mix and match LectroTest with these modules.\n"
"\n"
"Finally, we give the whole Property a name, in this case \"my_function "
"output is non-negative.\" It's a good idea to use a meaningful name because "
"LectroTest refers to properties by name in its output.\n"
"\n"
"Let's take a look at the finished property specification:\n"
"\n"
"    Property {                  MyModule::my_function( $x, $y ) >= 0;     }, "
"name => \"my_function output is non-negative\" ;\n"
"\n"
"It says, \"For all integers _x_ and _y_, we assert that my_function's output "
"is non-negative.\"\n"
"\n"
"To check whether this property holds, simply put it in a Perl program that "
"uses the Test::LectroTest module. (See the SYNOPSIS for an example.) When "
"you run the program, LectroTest will load the property (and any others in "
"the file) and check it by running random trials against the software you're "
"testing. \n"
"*Note:* If you want to place LectroTest property checks into a test plan "
"managed by Test::Builder-based modules such as Test::Simple or Test::More, "
"see Test::LectroTest::Compat.\n"
"\n"
"If LectroTest is able to \"break\" your software during the property check, "
"it will emit a counterexample to your property's assertions and stop. You "
"can plug the counterexample back into your software to debug the problem. "
"(You might also want to add the counterexample to a list of regression "
"tests.)\n"
"\n"
"A successful LectroTest looks like this:\n"
"\n"
"  1..1   ok 1 - 'my_function output is non-negative' (1000 attempts)\n"
"\n"
"On the other hand, if you're not so lucky:\n"
"\n"
"  1..1   not ok 1 - 'my_function output is non-negative' falsified \\       "
"in 324 attempts"

"At some point or another, most programmers find they need to compare "
"floating-point numbers for equality. The typical idiom is to test if the "
"absolute value of the difference of the numbers is within a desired "
"tolerance, usually called epsilon. This module provides such a function for "
"use with the Test::More manpage. Usage is similar to other test functions "
"described in the Test::More manpage. Semantically, the 'delta_within' "
"function replaces this kind of construct:\n"
"\n"
" ok ( abs($p - $q) < $epsilon, '$p is equal to $q' ) or      diag \"$p is "
"not equal to $q to within $epsilon\";\n"
"\n"
"While there's nothing wrong with that construct, it's painful to type it "
"repeatedly in a test script. This module does the same thing with a single "
"function call. The 'delta_ok' function is similar, but either uses a global "
"default value for epsilon or else calculates a 'relative' epsilon on the fly "
"so that epsilon is scaled automatically to the size of the arguments to "
"'delta_ok'. Both functions are exported automatically.\n"
"\n"
"Because checking floating-point equality is not always reliable, it is not "
"possible to check the 'equal to' boundary of 'less than or equal to "
"epsilon'. Therefore, Test::Number::Delta only compares if the absolute value "
"of the difference is *less than* epsilon (for equality tests) or\n"
"*greater than* epsilon (for inequality tests)."

"This module provides bare bones 'try'/'catch'/'finally' statements that are "
"designed to minimize common mistakes with eval blocks, and NOTHING else.\n"
"\n"
"This is unlike TryCatch which provides a nice syntax and avoids adding "
"another call stack layer, and supports calling 'return' from the 'try' block "
"to return from the parent subroutine. These extra features come at a cost of "
"a few dependencies, namely Devel::Declare and Scope::Upper which are "
"occasionally problematic, and the additional catch filtering uses Moose type "
"constraints which may not be desirable either.\n"
"\n"
"The main focus of this module is to provide simple and reliable error "
"handling for those having a hard time installing TryCatch, but who still "
"want to write correct 'eval' blocks without 5 lines of boilerplate each "
"time.\n"
"\n"
"It's designed to work as correctly as possible in light of the various "
"pathological edge cases (see BACKGROUND) and to be compatible with any style "
"of error values (simple strings, references, objects, overloaded objects, "
"etc).\n"
"\n"
"If the 'try' block dies, it returns the value of the last statement executed "
"in the 'catch' block, if there is one. Otherwise, it returns 'undef' in "

"\" } || \"bar\";   my $x = (try { die \"foo\" }) // \"bar\";\n"
"\n"
"  my $x = eval { die \"foo\" } || \"bar\";\n"

"You can add 'finally' blocks, yielding the following:\n"
"\n"
"  my $x;   try { die 'foo' } finally { $x = 'bar' };   try { die 'foo' } "
"catch { warn \"Got a die: $_\" } finally { $x = 'bar' };\n"

"'finally' blocks are always executed making them suitable for cleanup code "
"which cannot be handled using local. You can add as many 'finally' blocks to "
"a given 'try' block as you like.\n"

"'eval', but it is not consistent with 'try'/'finally' patterns found in "
"other programming languages, such as Java, Python, Javascript or C#. If you "

"This module implements some sane defaults for Perl programs, as defined by "
"two typical (or not so typical - use your common sense) specimens of Perl "
"coders. In fact, after working out details on which warnings and strict "
"modes to enable and make fatal, we found that we (and our code written so "

"\n"
"Two typical examples of how this philosophy is applied in practise is the "

"* _uninitialised_\n"
"\n"
"  'undef' is a well-defined feature of perl, and enabling warnings for   "
"using it rarely catches any bugs, but considerably limits you in what you   "

"* _malloc_\n"

"  Freeing something twice on the C level is a serious bug, usually causing   "
"memory corruption. It often leads to side effects much later in the   "
"program and there are no advantages to not reporting this, so malloc   "
"warnings are fatal by default.\n"

"Unfortunately, there is no fine-grained warning control in perl, so often "

"This module is based on \"'Carp.pm'\" from Perl 5.005_03. It has been "
"modified to skip all package names matching the pattern given in the \"use\" "
"statement inside the \"'qw()'\" term (or argument list).\n"
"\n"
"Suppose you have a family of modules or classes named \"Pack::A\", \"Pack::B"
"\" and so on, and each of them uses \"'Carp::Clan qw(^Pack::);'\" (or at "
"least the one in which the error or warning gets raised).\n"
"\n"
"Thus when for example your script \"tool.pl\" calls module \"Pack::A\", and "
"module \"Pack::A\" calls module \"Pack::B\", an exception raised in module "
"\"Pack::B\" will appear to have originated in \"tool.pl\" where \"Pack::A\" "
"was called, and not in \"Pack::A\" where \"Pack::B\" was called, as the "
"unmodified \"'Carp.pm'\" would try to make you believe ':-)'.\n"
"\n"
"This works similarly if \"Pack::B\" calls \"Pack::C\" where the exception is "
"raised, et cetera.\n"
"\n"
"In other words, this blames all errors in the \"'Pack::*'\" modules on the "
"user of these modules, i.e., on you. ';-)'\n"
"\n"
"The skipping of a clan (or family) of packages according to a pattern "
"describing its members is necessary in cases where these modules are not "
"classes derived from each other (and thus when examining '@ISA' - as in the "
"original \"'Carp.pm'\" module - doesn't help).\n"
"\n"
"The purpose and advantage of this is that a \"clan\" of modules can work "
"together (and call each other) and throw exceptions at various depths down "
"the calling hierarchy and still appear as a monolithic block (as though they "
"were a single module) from the perspective of the caller.\n"
"\n"
"In case you just want to ward off all error messages from the module in "
"which you \"'use Carp::Clan'\", i.e., if you want to make all error messages "
"or warnings to appear to originate from where your module was called (this "
"is what you usually used to \"'use Carp;'\" for ';-)'), instead of in your "
"module itself (which is what you can do with a \"die\" or \"warn\" anyway), "
"you do not need to provide a pattern, the module will automatically provide "
"the correct one for you.\n"
"\n"
"I.e., just \"'use Carp::Clan;'\" without any arguments and call \"carp\" or "
"\"croak\" as appropriate, and they will automatically defend your module "
"against all blames!\n"
"\n"

"modules (more than one) work together and appear as though they were only "
"one."

">SUPER::foo(@_)'. I for one have trouble remembering that exact invocation, "
"so my classes seldom re-dispatch to their base classes. Very bad!\n"
"\n"
"'Class::Method::Modifiers' provides three modifiers: 'before', 'around', and "

"method. See the MODIFIERS section for more details on how the particular "
"modifiers work.\n"
"\n"
"One clear benefit of using 'Class::Method::Modifiers' is that you can define "
"multiple modifiers in a single namespace. These separate modifiers don't "
"need to know about each other. This makes top-down design easy. Have a base "
"class that provides the skeleton methods of each operation, and have plugins "
"modify those methods to flesh out the specifics.\n"
"\n"
"Parent classes need not know about 'Class::Method::Modifiers'. This means "

"Date::Manip is a series of modules designed to make any common date/time "
"operation easy to do. Operations such as comparing two times, determining a "
"date a given amount of time from another, or parsing international times are "
"all easily done. It deals with time as it is used in the Gregorian calendar "
"(the one currently in use) with full support for time changes due to "
"daylight saving time.\n"
"\n"
"From the very beginning, the main focus of Date::Manip has been to be able "
"to do ANY desired date/time operation easily. Many other modules exist which "
"may do a subset of these operations quicker or more efficiently, but no "
"other module can do all of the operations available in Date::Manip.\n"
"\n"
"Date::Manip has functionality to work with several fundamental types of "
"data. \n"
"* *dates*\n"
"\n"
"The word date is used extensively here and is somewhat misleading. In Date::"
"Manip, a date consists of three pieces of information: a calendar date "
"(year, month, day), a time of day (hour, minute, second), and time zone "
"information. Calendar dates and times are fully handled. Time zones are "
"handled as well, but depending on how you use Date::Manip, there may be some "
"limitations as discussed below. \n"
"* *delta*\n"
"\n"
"A delta is an amount of time (i.e. the amount of time between two different "
"dates). Think of it as the duration of an event or the amount of time "
"between two dates.\n"
"\n"
"A delta refers only to an amount of time. It includes no information about a "
"starting or ending date/time. Most people will think of a delta as an amount "
"of time, but the term 'time' is already used so much in this module that I "
"didn't want to use it here in order to avoid confusion. \n"
"* *recurrence*\n"
"\n"
"A recurring event is something which occurs on a regular recurring basis. \n"
"* *holidays* and *events*\n"
"\n"
"Holidays and events are basically named dates or recurrences.\n"
"\n"
"Among other things, Date::Manip allow you to: \n"
"* ***\n"
"\n"
"Enter a date in practically any format you choose. \n"
"* ***\n"
"\n"
"Compare two dates, entered in widely different formats to determine which is "
"earlier. \n"
"* ***\n"
"\n"
"Extract any information you want from a date using a format string similar "
"to the Unix date command. \n"
"* ***\n"
"\n"
"Determine the amount of time between two dates, or add an amount of time (a "
"delta) to a date to get a second date. \n"
"* ***\n"
"\n"
"Work with dates using international formats (foreign month names, 12/10/95 "
"referring to October rather than December, etc.). \n"
"* ***\n"
"\n"
"Convert dates from one timezone to another. \n"
"* ***\n"
"\n"
"To find a list of dates where a recurring event happens.\n"
"\n"
"Each of these tasks is trivial (one or two lines at most) with this package."

"RFCs 2822 and 822 specify date formats to be used by email. This module "

"\n"
"RFC2822 (April 2001) introduces a slightly different format of date than "

"* 3\n"

"    perl -MDevel::Hide=Test::Pod Makefile.PL\n"
"\n"

"and roles. This way, Moo classes can consume Moose roles, Moose classes can "
"extend Moo classes, and so forth.\n"
"\n"
"However, the surface syntax of Moo differs somewhat from Moose. For example "
"the 'isa' option when defining attributes in Moose must be either a string "
"or a blessed Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint object; but in Moo must be a "
"coderef. These differences in surface syntax make porting code from Moose to "

#. tumbleweed/perl-Quantum-Superpositions/description
msgid ""
"The Quantum::Superpositions module adds two new operators to Perl: 'any' and "
"'all'.\n"
"\n"
"Each of these operators takes a list of values (states) and superimposes "
"them into a single scalar value (a superposition), which can then be stored "
"in a standard scalar variable.\n"
"\n"
"The 'any' and 'all' operators produce two distinct kinds of superposition. "
"The 'any' operator produces a disjunctive superposition, which may "
"(notionally) be in any one of its states at any time, according to the needs "
"of the algorithm that uses it.\n"
"\n"
"In contrast, the 'all' operator creates a conjunctive superposition, which "
"is always in every one of its states simultaneously.\n"
"\n"
"Superpositions are scalar values and hence can participate in arithmetic and "
"logical operations just like any other type of scalar. However, when an "
"operation is applied to a superposition, it is applied (notionally) in "
"parallel to each of the states in that superposition.\n"
"\n"
"For example, if a superposition of states 1, 2, and 3 is multiplied by 2:\n"
"\n"
"\t$result = any(1,2,3) * 2;\n"
"\n"
"the result is a superposition of states 2, 4, and 6. If that result is then "
"compared with the value 4:\n"
"\n"
"\tif ($result == 4) { print \"fore!\" }\n"
"\n"
"then the comparison also returns a superposition: one that is both true and "
"false (since the equality is true for one of the states of '$result' and "
"false for the other two).\n"
"\n"
"Of course, a value that is both true and false is of no use in an 'if' "
"statement, so some mechanism is needed to decide which superimposed boolean "
"state should take precedence.\n"
"\n"
"This mechanism is provided by the two types of superposition available. A "
"disjunctive superposition is true if any of its states is true, whereas a "
"conjunctive superposition is true only if all of its states are true.\n"
"\n"
"Thus the previous example does print \"fore!\", since the 'if' condition is "
"equivalent to:\n"
"\n"
"\tif (any(2,4,6) == 4)...\n"
"\n"
"It suffices that any one of 2, 4, or 6 is equal to 4, so the condition is "
"true and the 'if' block executes.\n"
"\n"
"On the other hand, had the control statement been:\n"
"\n"
"        if (all(2,4,6) == 4)...\n"
"\n"
"the condition would fail, since it is not true that all of 2, 4, and 6 are "
"equal to 4.\n"
"\n"
"Operations are also possible between two superpositions:\n"
"\n"
"        if (all(1,2,3)*any(5,6) < 21)                 { print \"no alcohol"
"\"; }\n"
"\n"
"        if (all(1,2,3)*any(5,6) < 18)                 { print \"no entry"
"\"; }\n"
"\n"
"        if (any(1,2,3)*all(5,6) < 18)                 { print \"under-age"
"\" }\n"
"\n"
"In this example, the string \"no alcohol\" is printed because the "
"superposition produced by the multiplication is the Cartesian product of the "
"respective states of the two operands: 'all(5,6,10,12,15,18)'. Since all of "
"these resultant states are less that 21, the condition is true. In contrast, "
"the string \"no entry\" is not printed, because not all the product's states "
"are less than 18.\n"
"\n"
"Note that the type of the first operand determines the type of the result of "
"an operation. Hence the third string -- \"underage\" -- is printed, because "
"multiplying a disjunctive superposition by a conjunctive superposition "
"produces a result that is disjunctive: 'any(5,6,10,12,15,18)'. The condition "
"of the 'if' statement asks whether any of these values is less than 18, "
"which is true."

"Spreadsheet::ReadSXC extracts data from OpenOffice 1.x spreadsheet files (."
"sxc). It exports the function read_sxc() which takes a filename and an "
"optional reference to a hash of options as arguments and returns a reference "
"to a hash of references to two-dimensional arrays. The hash keys correspond "
"to the names of worksheets in the OpenOffice workbook. The two-dimensional "
"arrays correspond to rows and cells in the respective spreadsheets. If you "
"don't like this because the order of sheets is not preserved in a hash, read "
"on. The 'OrderBySheet' option provides an array of hashes instead.\n"
"\n"
"If you prefer to unpack the .sxc file yourself, you can use the function "
"read_xml_file() instead and pass the path to content.xml as an argument. Or "
"you can extract the XML string from content.xml and pass the string to the "
"function read_xml_string(). Both functions also take a reference to a hash "
"of options as an optional second argument.\n"
"\n"
"Spreadsheet::ReadSXC requires XML::Parser to parse the XML contained in .sxc "
"files. Only the contents of text:p elements are returned, not the actual "
"values of table:value attributes. For example, a cell might have a table:"
"value-type attribute of \"currency\", a table:value attribute of "
"\"-1500.99\" and a table:currency attribute of \"USD\". The text:p element "
"would contain \"-$1,500.99\". This is the string which is returned by the "
"read_sxc() function, not the value of -1500.99.\n"
"\n"
"Spreadsheet::ReadSXC was written with data import into an SQL database in "
"mind. Therefore empty spreadsheet cells correspond to undef values in array "
"rows. The example code above shows how to replace undef values with empty "
"strings.\n"
"\n"
"If the .sxc file contains an empty spreadsheet its hash element will point "
"to an empty array (unless you use the 'NoTruncate' option in which case it "
"will point to an array of an array containing one undefined element).\n"
"\n"
"OpenOffice uses UTF-8 encoding. It depends on your environment how the data "
"returned by the XML Parser is best handled:\n"
"\n"
"  use Unicode::String qw(latin1 utf8);   $unicode_string = utf8($"
"$workbook_ref{\"Sheet1\"}[0][0])->as_string;\n"
"\n"
"  \n"
"\n"
"  $latin1_string = utf8($$workbook_ref{\"Sheet1\"}[0][0])->latin1;\n"
"\n"
"Of course there are other modules than Unicode::String on CPAN that handle "
"conversion between encodings. It's your choice.\n"
"\n"
"Table rows in .sxc files may have a \"table:number-rows-repeated\" "
"attribute, which is often used for consecutive empty rows. When you format "
"whole rows and/or columns in OpenOffice, it sets the numbers of rows in a "
"worksheet to 32,000 and the number of columns to 256, even if only a few "
"lower-numbered rows and cells actually contain data. Spreadsheet::ReadSXC "
"truncates such sheets so that there are no empty rows after the last row "
"containing data and no empty columns after the last column containing data "
"(unless you use the 'NoTruncate' option).\n"
"\n"
"Still it is perfectly legal for an .sxc file to apply the \"table:number-"
"rows-repeated\" attribute to rows that actually contain data (although I "
"have only been able to produce such files manually, not through OpenOffice "
"itself). To save on memory usage in these cases, Spreadsheet::ReadSXC does "
"not copy rows by value, but by reference (remember that multi-dimensional "
"arrays in Perl are really arrays of references to arrays). Therefore, if you "
"change a value in one row, it is possible that you find the corresponding "
"value in the next row changed, too:\n"
"\n"
"  $$workbook_ref{\"Sheet1\"}[0][0] = 'new string';   print $"
"$workbook_ref{\"Sheet1\"}[1][0];\n"
"\n"
"As of version 0.20 the references returned by read_sxc() et al. remain valid "
"after subsequent calls to the same function. In earlier versions, calling "
"read_sxc() with a different file as the argument would change the data "
"referenced by the original return value, so you had to derefence it before "
"making another call. Thanks to H. Merijn Brand for fixing this."
