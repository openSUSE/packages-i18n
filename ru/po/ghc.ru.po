"Toolbox uses a generic data model for representing XML documents, including "
"the DTD subset and the document subset, in Haskell. It contains a validating "
"XML parser, a HTML parser, namespace support, an XPath expression evaluator, "
"an XSLT library, a RelaxNG schema validator and funtions for serialization "
"and deserialization of user defined data. The library makes extensive use of "
"the arrow approach for processing XML. Since version 9 the toolbox is "
"partitioned into various (sub-)packages. This package contains the core "
"functionality, hxt-curl, hxt-tagsoup, hxt-relaxng, hxt-xpath, hxt-xslt, hxt-"
"regex-xmlschema contain the extensions. hxt-unicode contains encoding and "
"decoding functions, hxt-charproperties char properties for unicode and XML.\n"

"A 'Category' is any 'Semigroupoid' for which the Yoneda lemma holds.\n"

"When working with comonads you often have the '<*>' portion of an "
"'Applicative', but not the 'pure'. This was captured in Uustalu and Vene's "
"\"Essence of Dataflow Programming\" in the form of the 'ComonadZip' class in "
"the days before 'Applicative'. Apply provides a weaker invariant, but for "
"the comonads used for data flow programming (found in the streams package), "
"this invariant is preserved. Applicative function composition forms a "
"semigroupoid.\n"

"The zip-archive library provides functions for creating, modifying, and "

"<http://www.pkware.com/documents/casestudies/APPNOTE.TXT>.\n"
"\n"
"Certain simplifying assumptions are made about the zip archives: in "
"particular, there is no support for strong encryption, zip files that span "
"multiple disks, ZIP64, OS-specific file attributes, or compression methods "
"other than Deflate. However, the library should be able to read the most "
"common zip archives, and the archives it produces should be readable by all "
"standard unzip programs.\n"
"\n"
"Archives are built and extracted in memory, so manipulating large zip files "
"will consume a lot of memory. If you work with large zip files or need "
"features not supported by this library, a better choice may be <http://"
"hackage.haskell.org/package/zip zip>, which uses a memory-efficient "
"streaming approach. However, zip can only read and write archives inside "
"instances of MonadIO, so zip-archive is a better choice if you want to "
"manipulate zip archives in \"pure\" contexts.\n"
"\n"

"extracter is provided in the source distribution."

"QuickCheck is a library for random testing of program properties. The "
