"extremely simple, it is useful to have a base API that facilitates using the "
"pattern, and (more importantly) encouraging composition of command "
"implementations from multiple diverse sources. Towards that end, the Chain "
"API models a computation as a series of \"commands\" that can be combined "
"into a \"chain\". The API for a command consists of a single method "
"(execute()), which is passed a \"context\" parameter containing the dynamic "
"state of the computation, and whose return value is a boolean that "
"determines whether or not processing for the current chain has been "
"completed (true), or whether processing should be delegated to the next "
"command in the chain (false)."

#~ "\n"
#~ "Granted, this removes some of the expressive power that is inherent by "
