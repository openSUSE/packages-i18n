"This 52-card solitaire starts with the entire deck shuffled and dealt out in "
"four rows. The aces are then moved to the left end of the layout, making 4 "
"initial free spaces. You may move to a space only the card that matches the "
"left neighbor in suit, and is one greater in rank. Kings are high, so no "
"cards may be placed to their right (they create dead spaces).\n"
"\n"
"When no moves can be made, cards still out of sequence are reshuffled and "
"dealt face up after the ends of the partial sequences, leaving a card space "
"after each sequence, so that each row looks like a partial sequence followed "
"by a space, followed by enough cards to make a row of 14. A moment's "
"reflection will show that this game cannot take more than 13 deals. A good "
"score is 1-3 deals, 4-7 is average, 8 or more is poor."
