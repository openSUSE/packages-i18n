#. leap/VirtualGL/description
#. leap/VirtualGL/VirtualGL-devel/description
msgid ""
"VirtualGL is a library which allows most Linux OpenGL applications to be "
"remotely displayed to a thin client without the need to alter the "
"applications in any way.  VGL inserts itself into an application at run time "
"and intercepts a handful of GLX calls, which it reroutes to the server's "
"display (which presumably has a 3D accelerator attached.)  This causes all "
"3D rendering to occur on the server's display.  As each frame is rendered by "
"the server, VirtualGL reads back the pixels from the server's framebuffer "
"and sends them to the client for re-compositing into the appropriate X "
"Window.  VirtualGL can be used to give hardware-accelerated 3D capabilities "
"to VNC or other remote display environments that lack GLX support.  In a LAN "
"environment, it can also be used with its built-in motion-JPEG video "
"delivery system to remotely display full-screen 3D applications at 20+ "
"frames/second.\n"
"\n"
"VirtualGL is based upon ideas presented in various academic papers on this "
"topic, including \"A Generic Solution for Hardware-Accelerated Remote "
"Visualization\" (Stegmaier, Magallon, Ertl 2002) and \"A Framework for "
"Interactive Hardware Accelerated Remote 3D-Visualization\" (Engel, Sommer, "
"Ertl 2000.)"

"Velocity is a Java-based template engine. It permits anyone to use the "

"capabilities reach well beyond the realm of web sites; for example, it can "

"transformations) from templates. It can be used either as a standalone "
"utility for generating source code and reports, or as an integrated "

"Calculate the Replay Gain for Ogg Vorbis files\n"
"\n"
"VorbisGain is a utility that uses a psychoacoustic method to correct the "
"volume of an Ogg Vorbis file to a predefined standardized loudness.\n"
"\n"
"It is meant as a replacement for the normalization that is commonly used "
"before encoding. Although normalization will ensure that each song has the "
"same peak volume, this unfortunately does not say anything about the "
"apparent loudness of the music, with the end result being that many "
"normalized files still don't sound equally loud. VorbisGain uses "
"psychoacoustics to address this deficiency. Moreover, unlike normalization, "
"it's a lossless procedure which works by adding tags to the file. "
"Additionally, it will add hints that can be used to prevent clipping on "
"playback. It is based upon the ReplayGain technology.\n"
"\n"
"The end result is that playback is both more convenient and of higher "
"quality compared to a non-VorbisGain'ed file."

" Velocity is a Java-based template engine. It permits anyone to use the "

"code. When Velocity is used for web development, Web designers can work in "
"parallel with Java programmers to develop web sites according to the Model-"
"View-Controller (MVC) model, meaning that web page designers can focus "
"solely on creating a site that looks good, and programmers can focus solely "
"on writing top-notch code. Velocity separates Java code from the web pages, "
"making the web site more maintainable over the long run and providing a "
"viable alternative to Java Server Pages (JSPs) or PHP. Velocity's "
"capabilities reach well beyond the realm of web sites; for example, it can "
"generate SQL and PostScript and XML (see Anakia for more information on XML "
"transformations) from templates. It can be used either as a standalone "
"utility for generating source code and reports, or as an integrated "
"component of other systems. Velocity also provides template services for the "
"Turbine web application framework. Velocity+Turbine provides a template "
