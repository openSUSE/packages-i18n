"A 'Semigroupoid' is a 'Category' without the requirement of identity arrows "
"for every object in the category.\n"
"\n"
"A 'Category' is any 'Semigroupoid' for which the Yoneda lemma holds.\n"
"\n"
"When working with comonads you often have the '<*>' portion of an "
"'Applicative', but not the 'pure'. This was captured in Uustalu and Vene's "
"\"Essence of Dataflow Programming\" in the form of the 'ComonadZip' class in "
"the days before 'Applicative'. Apply provides a weaker invariant, but for "
"the comonads used for data flow programming (found in the streams package), "
"this invariant is preserved. Applicative function composition forms a "
"semigroupoid.\n"

"Similarly many structures are nearly a comonad, but not quite, for instance "
"lists provide a reasonable 'extend' operation in the form of 'tails', but do "

"This lets us remove many of the restrictions from various monad transformers "
"as in many cases the binding operation or '<*>' operation does not require "
"them.\n"
"\n"
"Finally, to work with these weaker structures it is beneficial to have "
"containers that can provide stronger guarantees about their contents, so "
"versions of 'Traversable' and 'Foldable' that can be folded with just a "

"On most Unix systems, `mv` is an atomic operation. This makes it simple to "
"write to a file atomically just by using the mv operation. However, this "

"following to preserve permissions while atomically writing to a file: \n"
"* If an original file exists, take those permissions and apply them to the "
"temp file before `mv`ing the file into place. \n"
"* If the original file does not exist, create a following with default "
"permissions (based on the currently-active umask).\n"

"* 'printf' (from 'Text.Printf') takes a formatting string and uses some type "
"tricks to accept the rest of the arguments polyvariadically. It's very "
"concise, but there are some drawbacks – it can't produce 'Text' (you'd have "
"to 'T.pack' it every time) and it doesn't warn you at compile-time if you "
"pass wrong arguments or not enough of them. \n"
"* <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/text-format text-format> takes a "
"formatting string with curly braces denoting places where arguments would be "
"substituted (the arguments themselves are provided via a tuple). If you want "
"to apply formatting to some of the arguments, you have to use one of the "
"provided formatters. Like 'printf', it can fail at runtime, but at least the "
"formatters are first-class (and you can add new ones). \n"
"* <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/formatting formatting> takes a "
"formatting template consisting of pieces of strings interleaved with "

"'formatting' provides lots of formatters and generally seems to be the most "

"writing new formatters can be awkward and people sometimes have troubles "
"understanding how 'formatting' works. \n"
"* <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/fmt fmt> (i.e. this library) provides "
"formatters that are ordinary functions, and a bunch of operators for "
"concatenating formatted strings; those operators also do automatic "
"conversion. There are some convenience formatters which aren't present in "
"'formatting' (like ones for formatting maps, lists, converting to base64, "

"generics, including the 'Generic(1)' classes and representation data types. "
"On modern versions of GHC, this simply re-exports \"GHC.Generics\" from "
"'base'. On older versions of GHC, this module backports parts of \"GHC."
"Generics\" that were not included at the time, including 'Generic(1)' "
"instances. \n"
"* \"Generics.Deriving.TH\" implements Template Haskell functionality for "
"deriving instances of 'Generic(1)'. \n"
"* Educational code: in order to provide examples of how to define and use "
"\"GHC.Generics\"-based defaults, this library offers a number of modules "
"which define examples of type classes along with default implementations for "
"the classes' methods. Currently, the following modules are provided: "
"\"Generics.Deriving.Copoint\", \"Generics.Deriving.ConNames\", \"Generics."
"Deriving.Enum\", \"Generics.Deriving.Eq\", \"Generics.Deriving.Foldable\", "
"\"Generics.Deriving.Functor\", \"Generics.Deriving.Monoid\", \"Generics."
"Deriving.Semigroup\", \"Generics.Deriving.Show\", \"Generics.Deriving."
"Traversable\", and \"Generics.Deriving.Uniplate\".\n"
"\n"
"It is worth emphasizing that these modules are primarly intended for "
"educational purposes. Many of the classes in these modules resemble other "
"commonly used classes—for example, 'GShow' from \"Generics.Deriving.Show\" "
"resembles 'Show' from 'base'—but in general, the classes that 'generic-"
"deriving' defines are not drop-in replacements. Moreover, the generic "
"defaults that 'generic-deriving' provide often make simplifying assumptions "
"that may violate expectations of how these classes might work elsewhere. For "
"example, the generic default for 'GShow' does not behave exactly like "
"'deriving Show' would.\n"
"\n"
"If you are seeking \"GHC.Generics\"-based defaults for type classes in "
"'base', consider using the '<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/generic-data "
"generic-data>' library. \n"
"* \"Generics.Deriving.Default\" provides newtypes that allow leveraging the "
"generic defaults in this library using the 'DerivingVia' GHC language "
"extension. \n"
"* \"Generics.Deriving\" re-exports \"Generics.Deriving.Base\", \"Generics."
"Deriving.Default\", and a selection of educational modules."

msgid ""
"This package provides a couple of different implementations of mutable hash "
"tables in the ST monad, as well as a typeclass abstracting their common "
"operations, and a set of wrappers to use the hash tables in the IO monad.\n"
"\n"
"/QUICK START/: documentation for the hash table operations is provided in "
"the \"Data.HashTable.Class\" module, and the IO wrappers (which most users "
"will probably prefer) are located in the \"Data.HashTable.IO\" module.\n"
"\n"
"This package currently contains three hash table implementations:\n"
"\n"
"1. \"Data.HashTable.ST.Cuckoo\" contains an implementation of \"cuckoo "
"hashing\" as introduced by Pagh and Rodler in 2001 (see <http://en.wikipedia."
"org/wiki/Cuckoo_hashing>). Cuckoo hashing has worst-case /O(1)/ lookups and "
"can reach a high \"load factor\", in which the table can perform acceptably "
"well even when approaching 90% full. Randomized testing shows this "
"implementation of cuckoo hashing to be slightly faster on insert and "
"slightly slower on lookup than \"Data.HashTable.ST.Basic\", while being more "
"space efficient by about a half-word per key-value mapping. Cuckoo hashing, "
"like the basic hash table implementation using linear probing, can suffer "
"from long delays when the table is resized.\n"
"\n"
"2. \"Data.HashTable.ST.Basic\" contains a basic open-addressing hash table "
"using linear probing as the collision strategy. On a pure speed basis it "
"should currently be the fastest available Haskell hash table implementation "
"for lookups, although it has a higher memory overhead than the other tables "
"and can suffer from long delays when the table is resized because all of the "
"elements in the table need to be rehashed.\n"
"\n"
"3. \"Data.HashTable.ST.Linear\" contains a linear hash table (see <http://en."
"wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_hashing>), which trades some insert and lookup "
"performance for higher space efficiency and much shorter delays when "
"expanding the table. In most cases, benchmarks show this table to be "
"currently slightly faster than 'Data.HashTable' from the Haskell base "
"library.\n"
"\n"
"It is recommended to create a concrete type alias in your code when using "
"this package, i.e.:\n"
"\n"
"> import qualified Data.HashTable.IO as H > > type HashTable k v = H."
"BasicHashTable k v > > foo :: IO (HashTable Int Int) > foo = do > ht <- H."
"new > H.insert ht 1 1 > return ht\n"
"\n"
"Firstly, this makes it easy to switch to a different hash table "
"implementation, and secondly, using a concrete type rather than leaving your "
"functions abstract in the HashTable class should allow GHC to optimize away "
"the typeclass dictionaries.\n"
"\n"
"This package accepts a couple of different cabal flags: \n"
"* 'unsafe-tricks', default /ON/. If this flag is enabled, we use some unsafe "
"GHC-specific tricks to save indirections (namely 'unsafeCoerce#' and "
"'reallyUnsafePtrEquality#'. These techniques rely on assumptions about the "
"behaviour of the GHC runtime system and, although they've been tested and "
"should be safe under normal conditions, are slightly dangerous. Caveat "
"emptor. In particular, these techniques are incompatible with HPC code "
"coverage reports. \n"
"* 'sse42', default /OFF/. If this flag is enabled, we use some SSE 4.2 "
"instructions (see <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSE4>, first available on "
"Intel Core 2 processors) to speed up cache-line searches for cuckoo "
"hashing. \n"
"* 'bounds-checking', default /OFF/. If this flag is enabled, array accesses "
"are bounds-checked. \n"
"* 'debug', default /OFF/. If turned on, we'll rudely spew debug output to "
"stdout. \n"
"* 'portable', default /OFF/. If this flag is enabled, we use only pure "
"Haskell code and try not to use unportable GHC extensions. Turning this flag "
"on forces 'unsafe-tricks' and 'sse42' /OFF/.\n"

"lists). \n"
"* You want a library with a clean, understandable implementation (in which "
"case you're looking for <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-simple lens-"

#. tumbleweed/ghc-streaming/summary
msgid "An elementary streaming prelude and general stream type"
msgstr ""

#. tumbleweed/ghc-streaming/description
msgid ""
"This package contains two modules, <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/"
"streaming/docs/Streaming.html Streaming> and <http://hackage.haskell.org/"
"package/streaming/docs/Streaming-Prelude.html Streaming.Prelude>. The "
"principal module, <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/streaming-0.1.4.3/docs/"
"Streaming-Prelude.html Streaming.Prelude>, exports an elementary streaming "
"prelude focused on a simple \"source\" or \"producer\" type, namely 'Stream "
"(Of a) m r'. This is a sort of effectful version of '([a],r)' in which "
"successive elements of type 'a' arise from some sort of monadic action "
"before the succession ends with a value of type 'r'. Everything in the "
"library is organized to make programming with this type as simple as "
"possible, by the simple expedient of making it as close to 'Prelude' and "
"'Data.List' as possible. Thus for example the trivial program\n"
"\n"
"> >>> S.sum $ S.take 3 (S.readLn :: Stream (Of Int) IO ()) > 1<Enter> > "
"2<Enter> > 3<Enter> > 6 :> ()\n"
"\n"
"sums the first three valid integers from user input. Similarly,\n"
"\n"
"> >>> S.stdoutLn $ S.map (map toUpper) $ S.take 2 S.stdinLn > hello<Enter> > "
"HELLO > world!<Enter> > WORLD!\n"
"\n"
"upper-cases the first two lines from stdin as they arise, and sends them to "
"stdout. And so on, with filtering, mapping, breaking, chunking, zipping, "
"unzipping, replicating and so forth: we program with streams of 'Int's or "
"'String's directly as if they constituted something like a list. That's "
"because streams really do constitute something like a list, and the "
"associated operations can mostly have the same names. (A few, like "
"'reverse', don't stream and thus disappear; others like 'unzip' are here "
"given properly streaming formulation for the first time.) And we everywhere "
"oppose \"extracting a pure list from IO\", which is the origin of typical "
"Haskell memory catastrophes. Basically any case where you are tempted to use "
"'mapM', 'replicateM', 'traverse' or 'sequence' with Haskell lists, you would "
"do better to use something like 'Stream (Of a) m r'. The type signatures are "
"a little fancier, but the programs themselves are mostly the same. /In fact, "
"they are mostly simpler./ Thus, consider the trivial demo program mentioned "
"in <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24068399/haskell-performance-of-"
"iorefs this SO question>\n"
"\n"
"> main = mapM newIORef [1..10^8::Int] >>= mapM readIORef >>= mapM_ print\n"
"\n"
"The new user notices that this exhausts memory, and worries about the "
"efficiency of Haskell 'IORefs'. But of course it exhausts memory! Look what "
"it says! The problem is immediately cured by writing\n"
"\n"
"> main = S.print $ S.mapM readIORef $ S.mapM newIORef $ S.each [1..10^8::"
"Int]\n"
"\n"
"which really does what the other program was meant to do, uses no more "
"memory than 'hello-world', /and is simpler anyway/, since it doesn't involve "
"the detour of \"extracting a list from IO\". Almost every use of list "
"'mapM', 'replicateM', 'traverse' and 'sequence' produces this problem on a "
"smaller scale. People get used to it, as if it were characteristic of "
"Haskell programs to use a lot of memory. But in truth \"extracting a list or "
"sequence from IO\" is mostly just bad practice pure and simple. Of course, "
"'mapM', 'replicateM', 'traverse' and 'sequence' make sense for lists, under "
"certain conditions! But 'unsafePerformIO' also makes sense under certain "
"conditions.\n"
"\n"
"The <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/streaming-0.1.4.3/docs/Streaming."
"html Streaming> module exports the general type, 'Stream f m r', which can "
"be used to stream successive distinct steps characterized by /any/ functor "
"'f', though we are mostly interested in organizing computations of the form "
"'Stream (Of a) m r'. The streaming-IO libraries have various devices for "
"dealing with effectful variants of '[a]' or '([a],r)' in which the emergence "
"of successive elements somehow depends on IO. But it is only with the "
"general type 'Stream f m r', or some equivalent, that one can envisage (for "
"example) the connected streaming of their sorts of stream - as one makes "
"lists of lists in the Haskell 'Prelude' and 'Data.List'. One needs some such "
"type if we are to express properly streaming equivalents of e.g.\n"
"\n"
"> group :: Ord a => [a] -> [[a]] > chunksOf :: Int -> [a] -> [[a]] > "
"lines :: [Char] -> [[Char]] -- but similarly with byte streams, etc.\n"
"\n"
"to mention a few obviously desirable operations. (This is explained more "
"elaborately in the <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/streaming#readme "
"readme> below.)\n"
"\n"
"One could of course throw something like the present 'Stream' type on top of "
"a prior stream concept: this is how 'pipes' and 'pipes-group' (which are "
"very much our model here) use 'FreeT'. But once one grasps the iterable "
"stream concept needed to express those functions then one will also see "
"that, with it, one is /already/ in possession of a complete elementary "
"streaming library - since one possesses 'Stream ((,) a) m r' or equivalently "
"'Stream (Of a) m r'. This is the type of a 'generator' or 'producer' or "
"'source' or whatever you call an effectful stream of items. /The present "
"Streaming.Prelude is thus the simplest streaming library that can replicate "
"anything like the API of the Prelude and Data.List/.\n"
"\n"
"The emphasis of the library is on interoperation; for the rest its "
"advantages are: extreme simplicity, re-use of intuitions the user has "
"gathered from mastery of 'Prelude' and 'Data.List', and a total and "
"systematic rejection of type synonyms. The two conceptual pre-requisites are "
"some comprehension of monad transformers and some familiarity with 'rank 2 "
"types'. It is hoped that experimentation with this simple material, starting "
"with the ghci examples in 'Streaming.Prelude', will give people who are new "
"to these concepts some intuition about their importance. The most "
"fundamental purpose of the library is to express elementary streaming ideas "
"without reliance on a complex framework, but in a way that integrates "
"transparently with the rest of Haskell, using ideas - e.g. rank 2 types, "
"which are here implicit or explicit in most mapping - that the user can "
"carry elsewhere, rather than chaining her understanding to the curiosities "
"of a so-called streaming IO framework (as necessary as that is for certain "
"purposes.)\n"
"\n"
"See the <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/streaming#readme readme> below "
"for further explanation, including the examples linked there. Elementary "
"usage can be divined from the ghci examples in 'Streaming.Prelude' and "
"perhaps from this rough beginning of a <https://github.com/michaelt/"
"streaming-tutorial/blob/master/tutorial.md tutorial>. Note also the <https://"
"hackage.haskell.org/package/streaming-bytestring streaming bytestring> and "
"<https://hackage.haskell.org/package/streaming-utils streaming utils> "
"packages. Questions about usage can be put raised on StackOverflow with the "
"tag '[haskell-streaming]', or as an issue on Github, or on the <https://"
"groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/haskell-pipes pipes list> (the package "
"understands itself as part of the pipes 'ecosystem'.)\n"
"\n"
"The simplest form of interoperation with <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/"
"pipes pipes> is accomplished with this isomorphism:\n"
"\n"
"> Pipes.unfoldr Streaming.next :: Stream (Of a) m r -> Producer a m r > "
"Streaming.unfoldr Pipes.next :: Producer a m r -> Stream (Of a) m r\n"
"\n"
"Interoperation with <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/io-streams io-"
"streams> is thus:\n"
"\n"
"> Streaming.reread IOStreams.read :: InputStream a -> Stream (Of a) IO () > "
"IOStreams.unfoldM Streaming.uncons :: Stream (Of a) IO () -> IO (InputStream "
"a)\n"
"\n"
"With <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/conduit conduit> one might use, e."
"g.:\n"
"\n"
"> Conduit.unfoldM Streaming.uncons :: Stream (Of a) m () -> Source m a > str "
"-> Streaming.mapM_ Conduit.yield (hoist lift str) :: Stream (Of o) m r -> "
"ConduitM i o m r > src -> hoist lift str $$ Conduit.mapM_ Streaming.yield :: "
"Source m a\n"
"-> Stream (Of a) m ()\n"
"\n"
"These conversions should never be more expensive than a single '>->' or '="
"$='. The simplest interoperation with regular Haskell lists is provided by, "
"say\n"
"\n"
"> Streaming.each :: [a] -> Stream (Of a) m () > Streaming.toList_ :: Stream "
"(Of a) m r -> m [a]\n"
"\n"
"The latter of course accumulates the whole list in memory, and is mostly "
"what we are trying to avoid. Every use of 'Prelude.mapM f' should be "
"reconceived as using the composition 'Streaming.toList_ . Streaming.mapM f . "
"Streaming.each' with a view to considering whether the accumulation required "
"by 'Streaming.toList_' is really necessary.\n"
"\n"
"Here are the results of some <https://gist.github.com/"

#. tumbleweed/ghc-strict/description
msgid ""
"This package provides strict versions of some standard Haskell data types "
"(pairs, Maybe and Either). It also contains strict IO operations.\n"
"\n"
"It is common knowledge that lazy datastructures can lead to space-leaks. "
"This problem is particularly prominent, when using lazy datastructures to "
"store the state of a long-running application in memory. One common solution "
"to this problem is to use 'seq' and its variants in every piece of code that "
"updates your state. However a much easier solution is to use fully strict "
"types to store such state values. By \"fully strict types\" we mean types "
"for whose values it holds that, if they are in weak-head normal form, then "
"they are also in normal form. Intuitively, this means that values of fully "
"strict types cannot contain unevaluated thunks.\n"
"\n"
"To define a fully strict datatype, one typically uses the following recipe.\n"
"\n"
"1. Make all fields of every constructor strict; i.e., add a bang to all "
"fields.\n"
"\n"
"2. Use only strict types for the fields of the constructors.\n"
"\n"
"The second requirement is problematic as it rules out the use of the "
"standard Haskell 'Maybe', 'Either', and pair types. This library solves this "
"problem by providing strict variants of these types and their corresponding "
"standard support functions and type-class instances.\n"
"\n"
"Note that this library does currently not provide fully strict lists. They "
"can be added if they are really required. However, in many cases one "
"probably wants to use unboxed or strict boxed vectors from the 'vector' "
"library (<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/vector>) instead of strict "
"lists. Moreover, instead of 'String's one probably wants to use strict "
"'Text' values from the 'text' library (<http://hackage.haskell.org/package/"
"text>).\n"
"\n"
"This library comes with batteries included; i.e., mirror functions and "
"instances of the lazy versions in 'base'. It also includes instances for "
"type-classes from the 'deepseq', 'binary', and 'hashable' packages."
